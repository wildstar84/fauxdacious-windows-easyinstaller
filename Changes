Version 4.5-final [Updated 7/22/2025]:

This release provides numerous improvements to the "Skins" interfaces, 
minor improvements to the Qt and Moonstone interface playlist displays, 
numerous minor code and interface cleanups and polishing, removed support for 
.m4v videos (never worked properly), and all applicable Audacious changes 
in their latest v4.5 release.  See the gory details below and in the 
git commits.  Also Egnrse (https://github.com/egnrse) has been kind enough to 
create installable Fauxdacious packages for Arch Linux and has added them to 
their "AUR" repository (See Fauxdacious issue #20)!  For best results, All 
users should also take this opportunity to make sure that their Perl modules:  
StreamFinder, LyricFinder, LWP::Simple, LWP::UserAgent etc.; and Fauxdacious's 
helper-scripts are all up to date!

I've also broken with recent tradition and decided to release a new Windows 
release of v4.5-final!

The Gory Details:

* Updated transiflex translation files.

* Hopefully (I don't have Qt6 installed yet) eliminate all Qt6 depreciation 
compiler warnings.

* Queue-manager window (Qt) - Add ability to rearrange order of entries via 
drag & drop (Audacious change), and add a dedicated [Close] button to work 
more like the GTK version.  Also some other minor code changes to bring code 
up to date with Audacious.

* Playlist display (non-skinned interfaces):

1) Include file extension in the File Name column as part of the file-name 
(Audacious change), but also add new checkbox option (default checked) for 
this under Settings.Appearance:  "Include file ext. in Filename Column" to 
allow user to still show the old way (filename only, no extension) by 
unchecking.  Feature applies to GTK, Qt, & Moonstone playlist display.  GTK & 
Qt settings have separate setting for this, & Moonstone plugin uses the Qt 
setting.

2) Fix long-standing Audacious bug affecting the width of the last column in 
the GTK version.  Last column is expanded to fill remaining window space, but 
wouldn't remember the user-set width on restart.  Should work now, as this 
widget has a horizontal scrollbar.

Note:  In the GTK version, the only way to rearrange / reorder the columns 
selected for display is via dragging them within the righthand sid box titled 
"Displayed columns" in the Settings.Appearance screen, as the actual column 
headers are not themselves draggable (unlike the Qt version).  Therefore, I 
added a note in the Settings screen informing users of this "feature".

3) (Qt & Moonstone):  When right-clicking on a column header in the header-
bar to add a column to display, the new column will now be inserted just 
right of the column who's header was right-clicked on.  Previously new 
columns were appended to the right of the right-most column.  Note:  This 
won't add a column as the left-most column, but the "Now Playing" (status) 
column should generally always be the left-most column.  To force a different 
column to the leftmost position, simply drag it's header all the way to the 
left.

* Fix some Qt6 compiler warnings.

* Update bug-reporting url from old Audacious redmine bug-tracker url to 
our github's issues page url.  This also required a full Transiflex update to 
correct it there as well.  This closes Issue# 21.

* Skins (both GTK & Qt) - Overhauled numerous things to make them work much 
better.  This was overdue as I haven't used the Skins interfaces for a few 
years now!  This all started when I attempted to address Audacious feature-
request #1513, sent them a patch, and they redid it resulting in not only 
satisfying that request, but also fixing an (unknown to me at the time) long-
standing issue in how Audacious handled the old Winamp "OAIDU" menu-column of 
buttons.  This prompted me to look more in-depth into how this "should" be 
handled.  Since this had been "broken" for some time, I decided to add a new  
config. option to either use the "fixed & now-correct" ("Xmms") appearance or 
retain the long-standing Audacious ("Legacy") appearance (which even I think 
looks better on some of my and some Audacious-created skins), which I found 
also contain a separate hints file called "skin-classic.hints".  With some 
more tinkering & experimenting, I ended up needing to add a new hint option 
called "MainWinStreamInfoLabels" to deal with some "Classic" (WinAMP-2) 
skins displayed using the new "Classic Hints" config. option that don't 
include the bitrate & frequency abbreviations on the main window image.

In addition, I discovered that due to recent changes in the Qt main-window 
menus setup (see mains commit# 9403ee "Make playlist shortcuts require 
playlist focus", which has the bad side-effect of making most of the keyboard 
shortcuts defined for the skins menus not work now) necessitating re-defining 
most of them for the main window itself (in the playlist-widget).

To summarize, the main changes / improvements to the Skins interfaces are:

1) 2 new "Appearance" options:  "Use Classic skin hints, if available" and 
"Winamp [OAIDU] menustyle:".  

2) By default, the [OAIDU] menu, aka. the "clutterbar" is now always shown, 
instead of hidden (on most skins) until clicked or moused on ("Xmms" option).
Select "Legacy" for the old (hidden unless moused on) appearance.  Either way 
though, we now always show the state of the two "togglable" menu-options 
("A" and "D") as either "pressed" or "unpressed" (to address Audacious 
request# 1513) regardless of which option is chosen.

3) The default for "Display active titlebar when any window is focused" is 
now FALSE, as it should be more beneficial for most users to see which skins 
window has keyboard focus, as some bindings (namely the up & down arrows) now 
do different things depending on whether the main or playlist window has focus. 
If TRUE, Fauxdacious shows either all skins windows or none of them 
as "focused" as a group based on whether any of them have keyboard focused.

4) Tweaked the graphics and hints (skin[-classic].hints file(s)) for several of 
the skins created by me or Audacious due to a few minor flaws in how they were 
displayed that are somewhat more noticable to me now.  The Lavadacious (mine) 
looks much better, especially the titlebars & buttons in unshaded mode.  I 
also slightly adjusted the Default* skins (originally from Audacious) to now 
include the "OAIDU" menu-column by default (use the new "Legacy" option to 
hide it).

5) Most skins have a little triangle/arrow that points right when playing and 
a square or double-bar when stopped or paused respectively on the upper-left 
part of the main window.  Just to the left of this indicator is another tiny 
indicator, usually either an even tinier right-arrow or one, or two tiny 
squares one above the other that never change, either in Xmms or Audacious, but 
appear to be useful in indicating whether playback is set to continue (default) 
or stop or repeat the current song.  Therefore, I've modified the skins logic 
to display them in 1 of 3 states:  "Normal", "No Playlist Advance" (bottom 
indicator) and "Stop After This Song" (top indicator changes, in skins that 
support this).

6) Added main-window bindings for the [Up] & [Down] arrows to make it much 
easier to quickly change the volume (previously they moved the active row in 
the playlist window up and down, and still do if the playlist window has the 
keyboard focus).

7) (Re)Added most of the main menu keyboard shortcuts to the main-window 
key-bindings such that they're bound to both the main and playlist windows.

8) Fixed the [Shift-[Tab]] binding to actually work now (both Qt & GTK).  
This had apparently never worked.  Supposed to move the playlist screen to 
show the previous playlist (if multiple playlists are defined).

9) Found & fixed a cpl. main-window notifications to be more consistant.

10) Add new skin (WinAMP v2.9 default skin).

11) Fix failure of the "shaded" version of the playlist window to always 
display (ie. stay in sync with) the proper title (of the currently-playing 
song, if any), as it did not update when song title changed in streaming 
radio-stations, or when "rolled up" (shaded from an unshaded state).  
Seems to have been long-broken since Audacious.

* Add a GTK version of the recently-added Qt-only Playback-History plugin!
Includes all the features in the Fauxdacious-enhanced version plus the ability 
to select (highlight) all history-entries (by pressing Ctrl-a), and pasting 
the list of highlighted entries (titles or albums) into another app. perhaps 
to save to a text file!  TODO:  Add these two features to the Qt verson too.

* Merged in all Audacious bug-fixes & feature enhancements since v4.4.2-final 
release.  Details below:

* Prevent user from overwriting existing playlist when importing a playlist - 
We automatically create a new playlist containing the imported list unless the 
current/active playlist is empty, ie. newly-created.  This addresses 
Audacious issue# 1508 ("Avoid Audacious overwriting/replacing current playlist 
with imported one").

* Merged: Added Vumeter plugin to GTK versions (already in Qt versions).

* Merged: Added new Playback-History plugin to Qt versions.  Also enhance by 
adding an option to also report song metadata changes by streaming 
radio-stations.

* Merged: Fixed memory leaks in Jump-to-Song dialog window and other code-
cleanups and efficiencies found by Audacious sysbot affecting aac plugin, 
blur-scope, etc.

* Added some hotkeys & icons for Cut/Copy/Paste & a few other menu items.

* Note:  We did NOT remove the Moonstone(Qt) plugin from Fauxdacious, nor do we 
have any current intentions to do so in the future!

Additional Fauxdacious changes:

* Added "J" hotkey & menu entries for the Jump-to-Song dialog to various other 
places where it could be very useful, ie. Mini-Fauxdacious, Moonstone, & the 
main Qt playback menus.

* Added option to the new Playback-History(Qt) plugin to better record song/
album changes dynamically occuring in streaming radio-stations.

Version 4.4.2-final [Updated 12/17/2024]:

This release is mostly to merge numerous Audacious fixes/tweaks under the hood, 
but also a couple specific to Fauxdacious, along with a shiny new feature we 
added to the Lyrics plugins, but otherwise, mostly minor bugfixes & code 
touchups all over.  The gory details below (see commits list since v4.4-final 
for even gorier details). ;)  This release is mostly equivalent to Audacious 
version 4.5-devel.

Also note that this is the first release without a MS-Windows binary build, as 
I'm not able/willing to upgrade / overhaul my entire Windows build environment 
to that now used by Audacious and because I'm not a MS-Windows user.  I need 
someone who is and wishes to keep Fauxdacious for Windows relavent, to please 
step up and take over the Windows binary builds for me!  The last one 
(v4.4-final) is and will remain available for the forseeable future though!

* Cover Art Helper - Tweak a regular expression that sometimes failed cover-art 
fetching if the song's title or album name included parentheses.

* URL Helper - Add "hls_bandwidth=###" (kbps) option to the 
FauxdaciousUrlHelper.ini file for manually limiting the highest bandwidth 
stream selected by the FFAudio plugin (for users with limited bandwidth 
internet connections) as many HLS streams offer very high bandwidth streams 
now as their default (best) streams and the ffmpeg library does not appear 
to have an option to force selection of a lower-bandwidth stream when 
used programatically.

* Because nearly all .m3u8 entries these days are HLS streams & require 
the URL helper script to handle, no longer handle these as playlists via the 
M3u plugin (if problem, users should rename or symlink with .m3u extension & 
report here).

* Merged: Handle fonts whose font family names contain digits properly.

* Merged: Remove any white-space bracketing URLs added via the URL opener 
dialog.

* Pulseaudio - Specify properties for application ID and icon name.  This 
allows Pavucontrol for example to display the Fauxdacious icon instead of a 
general fallback icon. (Audacious)  Also correct previously wrong default 
stream name to "Fauxdacious" (was always "Audacious").

* Opus:  ReplayGain values for Opus files are now supported in both R128_* 
and REPLAYGAIN_* tags. (Audacious feature request #1500)

* FFAudio:  Added .adx file extension to entension list directly handled by 
ffaudio plugin. (Audacious feature request# 1466)

* Lyrics:  Merge in pull-request #4 by "lecheel" (https://github.com/lecheel) 
that adds an option to display lyrics data that includes "timestamps" in a 
dynamic display of three lines of lyrics at a time (previous, current & next) 
lines with current line highlighted (larger text) synced between each 
timestamp and the current playing position in the song entry.  The new option 
is on (checked) by default under Lyric plugin configuration as:  
"Enable scrolling lyric sync. by timestamps".  If the option is unchecked, OR 
if lyrics data does not include timestamps, then lyrics are displayed in their 
entirity, headed up by the song title & artist (as has always been the case).
Also added an "About" section.  These changes apply to all Qt & GTK versions 
of the Lyrics plugins.

* Several Audacious fixes/tweaks for Mac users merged.

* Numerous general code cleanups from Audacious.

Audacious changes omitted, deferred or non-applicable:

* Pipewire plugin changes - We currently do not include the Audacious Pipewire 
plugin, as I believe the PulseAudio plugin can already handle Pipewire.  Since 
I use neither Pulse nor Pipewire (I use Alsa sound), I have no way to test 
either.  If this is no longer true, file a report & I'll be happy to merge the 
Pipewire plugin.

* Alternative build environments (ie. Mesa, et. al.) - We do not currently 
support Meson building, as this would mean extensive changes and labor I'm not 
willing to expend on my own, as now just merging in all of Audacious's .meson 
files alone would not work due to numerous differences in our code-bases & I 
have zero-familiarity with meson (Pull requests WITH PATCHES welcome)! ;)

* libcddb build requirement - Audacious has removed this at the request of 
FreeBSD (Audacious request #1437) as archaic.  Upon attempting to remove this, 
I realized that we require it's ability to generate CD disk-IDs for use as 
keys to custom user-created metadata files (a feature Audacious does not 
offer).  I an not rejecting this outright, but deferring it for now until I can 
figure out a workable solution.  In other words, this is going to require alot 
more labor here than it did for Audacious (patches from FreeBSD'ers welcome)!  

Version 4.4-final [Updated 07/27/2024]:

* Welp, ONE DAY after this build was released, Youtube decided to screw up 
their streams necessitating a quick hotfix update for StreamFinder to enable 
continued access to Youtube videos, so I'm going ahead and releasing yet 
another "Final" final-build to include an updated Url-helper build that 
includes this upgrade (StreamFinder v2.40 - sigh!  NOTE:  You will also need 
to upgrade yt-dlp to v2024.07.25, and edit (or create) your 
c:Users/you/.config/StreamFinder/Youtube/config file to include the following 
option lines: (Sorry for this inconvience, but Youtube forced this on us, and 
I felt the "warrantee" on this last build should be more than one day!) 

# use yt-dlp, NOT youtube-dl!:
youtube-dl => "yt-dlp"
# try fetching best stream that contains BOTH audio AND video:
format => "b"
# if that fails, then try fetching best audio-only stream:
format-fallback => "ba"

NOTE:  non-Windows users:  You will just need to update (or install) yt-dlp and 
the StreamFinder perl module to latest versions, and edit (or create) your 
~/.config/StreamFinder/Youtube/config file to include the lines above!

* I've also gone ahead and included the latest GTK commit that makes toggling 
to classic icons on the Settings screen work without having to close and reopen 
that screen - a long-standing "rough-edge" that I was finally able to smooth 
off (The Qt one is non-applicable to the Windows build)!  Note: the v4.4-final 
version & 07192024 buildstamp remains.

* helpers - CoverArt:  An emergency hotfix was made to partially REVERT 
latest commit# 924c3db of 7/20 "Fix regex for titles w/unmatched '('" as this 
proved to be a regression (sorry!).  A new v4.4-final Windows build will be 
performed to include this correction, and in future updated heler binaries will 
be made available for individual downloads & upgrades, as there are currently 
no plans to release new full Windows builds of Fauxdacious & plugins going 
forward (for now, as stated here in the Changes file).  NOTE:  The rebuilt 
binary still has the same 07192024 buildstamp, as only a tiny part needed 
recompiling whereas a complete rebuild (extremely SLOW on my Windows 
environment) is required to change it.  Just make sure you download and 
reinstall after 07/27!

* Moonstone:  Add plugin configuration section to the Settings window for 
gui-configuration of important Moonston plugin parameters.

* GTK-ui:  Make playlist column sort-indicator arrows work for menu-initiated 
sorts and when multiple playlist tabs exist.  It is intended to also be 
included in the extra Windows 4.4-final build to correct the aformentioned 
CoverArt error hotfix.

*** WARNING: LIKELY FINAL BUILD FOR MS-WINDOWS, SEE BELOW: ***

This release is mostly merged Audacious build improvements and modernization 
to better support Qt-6 and Wayland.  Some minor code tweaks and bug-fixes all 
over, nothing spectacularly interesting.  The only shiny new stuff added was 
Audacious's Moonstone(Qt) plugin with some additional Fauxdacious flare!

One bug of note discovered and fixed at the last minute involved the Skins-GTK 
playlist window sometimes jumping back to the currently playing song when 
user would scroll up in the playlist window where the playing song scrolled 
off the window and the user then clicked on another song.  Sorry for not 
catching this sooner as I hardly ever use the skins interfaces anymore.  The 
Skins-Qt version appears to not be affected by this bug.  Another annoying 
issue was the hot-switching feature would silently switch back to the default 
instance when hot-switching between GTK & Qt versions while running an 
instance other than the default (using the --new=instancename) option.

One minor omission is the addition and requirement for the Qt*svg libraries, 
since unfortunately due to Debian's current "t64 fiasco" in Trixie.  I am 
currently unable to safely upgrade or install pretty much any new software 
until this drama settles down, and I did not have these libraries installed 
before this started.  It's also prevented me from installing and testing the 
Qt6 stuff, but I've added everything Qt6-related that Audacious has, and 
(if you have it installed), it should work.

Otherwise, for all the gory details, see the changes below and the commits 
since the v4.3-final release:

On a rather sad note, I'm strongly considering stopping further work on the 
MS-Windows version as I do not ever use Windows anymore, it's a lot of extra 
work to rebuild everything in Windows, the plugin libraries (the subset we 
actuially support) are now ancient and it seems to be very difficult to 
update them, and I've seen essentially zero uptake or interest in Fauxdacious 
for Windows. :(  Therefore, if you are using Fauxdacious on your Windows daily 
driver machine - PLEASE drop me a line letting me know you are using and 
appreciate it.  If I find there are actually USERS, I'll strongly consider 
continuing building.  Just need to know my labor is not in vain!  
Otherwise, v4.4-final will likely be the FINAL official Windows release!

Version 4.4-beta1

* Update library versions of libfauxdgui & libfauxdqt to match Audacious.

* Fix libfauxdcore tests suite to actually function.

* Minor fixes to the Opus plugin; and Qt's dark theme, particularly to work 
better with Qt6.

* Make Qt6 and GTK3 the default versions (use --enable-gtk2 and/or --enable-qt5 
to build with the older versions).

Version 4.4-devel (as/of 5/23/2024):

* Merge most Audacious bugfix & feature commits for Audacious v.4.4-beta1.  
Notable exceptions (not merged yet) are GTK & Qt default version commits, 
pending further testing.

* Add/merge Audacious Moonstone Qt interface plugin after massively refactoring 
to fix the long-standing issue I had with it leaving you trapped (unable to 
change back to a different interface without having to shut down and manually 
edit the Audacious settnigs config file).  Also refactored to have a much more 
refined UI, expecially by allowing the attached playlist pane to be shaded; 
and basically bring up to Fauxdacious's quality standards.  I submitted a 
patch request (#1355) to Audacious addressing these issues and they have 
ignored it (for almost a year now)!  Therefore, I'm merging it here now (so 
that my work doesn't go to waste, and our users will have another Audacious 
feature, but much improved (imho)!  Note:  This will not replace 
Mini-Fauxdacious, which will remain as-is as the preferred option (and is 
available in both GTK & Qt versions - whereas Moonstone is Qt-only)!

* statusicon - Tweak code & menu to work more in line w/Audacious versions.

* neon - Fix SSL certificate-handling on Windows version.

* ffaudio - Add support for dynamic icy-tags on streaming stations:

* Fix edge case where video window not restored to proper location.

* Harden a cpl code segments to prevent potential crashes (See commits for 
details.

* Update copyright year to 2024 & allign versioning to Audacious's.

* Fixed albumart plugins to now properly handle recent in-stream cover-art 
URLs from some streaming stations (i.iheart.com - I'm lookin' at YOU!) that 
now include parentheses (previously would fail due to a "shell error").

* Merge numerous other recent Audacious improvements & refinements.  
Note:  some Audacious issue commits such as "plugins menu entry icon", 
"effects & visualization icons in menus", "c++20 standard" compliance, and 
mpg123 "New Format" errors were already done a good while back in Fauxdacious!

* Add Lyrics plugin support for additional lyrics site:  chartlyrics.com in 
LyricFinder Perl module v1.30+.

Version 4.3-final:

This release is mostly a feature-enhancement release with very few bugs fixed 
(or found!).  The biggest new feature is the optional toolbar addition to all 
versions of the Mini-Fauxdacious plugin.  Other notable additions are:  

  * Highlighting the first entry added when adding entries (for easier quick-
    advance to them to start playing).
  * Improved handling of multi-line titles, easier access to the Mute 
    function via middle-button (mouse) and "m" (keyboard).
  * *Most* all applicable Audacious commits through June 1, 2023.
  * StreamFinder module upgraded to latest version 2.14, which supports three 
    new sites:  (Goodpods, Podchaser & RCast).  

Anyway, for full details, see the Changelog below and the GitHub commits since 
the previous final release.  This release brings us up to date with 
(and beyond) Audacious's version 4.3.1 final release.  Only notable absence 
I'm aware of is I have not added their "WM_WINDOW_ROLE" commits yet, as it 
involves modifying numerous source files and my ancient window-manager 
(AfterStep) doesn't even see nor need these.  If you're hurting for this, 
drop me an email and I'll get it done!  We also currently don't support 
meson builds.

The gory details:

* Transiflex language updates and a shiny new M$-Windows build (as always)!

* Add middle-mousebutton option to toggle mute on the volume-button 
(addresses Audacious feature-request #1213), but also add "m"-key press option 
to all versions of Mini-Fauxdacious to also toggle mute.

* Mini-Fauxdacious (GTK):  Merge most recent Qt-version feature additions, 
namely the optional toolbar and related new plugin-configuration options 
allowing users to select which buttons they want to appear on it.  
One can now toggle the toolbar either by double-clicking, or pressing the "t" 
key when focused.  I gave up (for the moment) trying to get the 
"Moonstone" background option to work on the GTK-2 version, but it does work 
on the GTK-3 (and Qt) versions!

* Mini-Fauxdacious (Qt): Add configuration checkboxes allowing user to change 
which options appear as buttons in the optional toolbar!  Also save separate 
window widths for the shaded (no toolbar) and unshaded (toolbar) versions of 
the plugin window making it easier for user to automatically change to a wider 
window when the toolbar is present (unshaded) if user has a large number of 
toolbar buttons turned on.  Also make it possible to toggle the toolbar's color 
scheme style (Audacious "Moonstone" vs. native style) on the fly (without 
having to restart the plugin).

* Mini-Fauxdacious (Qt): Add a toolbar option to the plugin to show a 
toolbar at the bottom of the Mini-Fauxdacious window very similar to the one 
in the main playlist window.  The new option is under the Plugins configuration 
window for the Mini-Fauxdacious Qt plugin.  The idea is to allow 
Mini-Fauxdacious the option to work more like Audacious's "Moonstone" plugin, 
to which Mini-Fauxdacious is Fauxdacious's intended alternative.  If active, 
the toolbar increases the height of the window by it's height, and by default, 
is styled after Fauxdacious's current style.  A second checkbox option allows 
displaying the toolbar in the same color-style as the one in Audacious's 
Moonstone plugin (a very light grey background).  To toggle the toolbar, the 
user can either double-click on the plugin window or pressing the "T" key (for 
Toolbar).  NOTE:  While the toolbar remains (if active) between docking and 
floating (undocking) the plugin window, it is not possible to toggle while 
docked, as this would corrupt the window-resizing capabilities of the main 
playlist window requiring a full restart of Fauxdacious.

* Shrink the height of the toolbar in the main Fauxdacious playlist window 
(Qt) version by about 6 pixels to save a bit of screen real estate.

* Add "On add, select 1st entry added" [Playlist] option to highlight (select) 
the newly-added entry (or the first entry in a list of newly-added entries) 
when adding entries to a playlist.  This (when combined with the "Advance to 
next selected entry in list" [Playlist] option just above it is also checked) 
makes it easy for the user (especially if using the Mini-Fauxdacious plugin) 
to quickly advance to and play the entry he just added by pressing [Next] or 
Ctrl-B without having to scroll down to the bottom of the playlist, find, and 
select and play it manually.

Version 4.2.2-final:

This release is a snapshot of v4.3-beta1 as of 2/24/23 in order to do a new 
Windows release and include most of the improvements since v4.2.1-final, along 
with many of Audacious's v4.3-beta1 GIT commits as/of 2/03/23 and plugin GIT 
commits through 2/11/23, since this has shown to be a good stopping-point in 
both our work and at Audacious.  

Users should also notice better stability in this release, as much work has 
been put into improving code quality and eliminating crashes, both actual 
and potential.  All users are strongly encouraged to update!

Other notable improvements are added GTK-3 support, hot-switching between GTK 
and Qt from within the GUI, and more consistent AlbumArt plugin / info-bar 
behaviour.

Notably absent (in the Windows version) are support for GTK3, and recent 
Sid-player and AdPlug plugin enhancements (requires recent libsidplay, etc.).  
The reason for reverting BACK from v4.3-beta1 to a v4.2.2-final is that we 
don't want to release a v4.3-final until Audacious ultimately does, but still 
release another "final" release before then.  For adplug, Fauxdacious for 
Windows provides the Adplug Classic plugin to handle adplug files.

Change log:

* Added a "Help" tab to the "About" window to display the Fauxdacious man-page.

* Added more workarounds for window-managers, particularly AfterStep (the one 
the author uses) and have modified the recommended AfterStep "database" 
settings for best results with Fauxdacious:

Style  "*"                 FocusOnMap
Style  "Fauxdacious_Qt"    NoFocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition, HonorGroupHints, HonorTransientHints, HonorExtWMHints
Style  "Fauxdacious_NF"    NoFocusOnMap, HonorPPosition, HonorExtWMHints
Style  "* Fauxdacious"     FocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition, HonorExtWMHints
Style  "*dacious Video"    NoFocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition
Style  "*dacious DVD"      FocusOnMap, Sticky, FocusOnMap, HonorPPosition
Style  "Mini-Fauxdacious*" NoTitle, NoFrame, NoHandles, Sticky, HonorPPosition

* Merged Qt "restore_floating_dockapps_late" config-file option into GTK to 
permit starting floating dock windows "late" (AFTER main window is up and 
focused) to ensure proper window ordering in window-managers' task-bars.
Also added the option to set this in the Settings gui under [Advanced].
Fauxdacious Extras section via a check-box.  NOTE: The GTK and Qt have separate 
values.

* Merged in Audacious's "hotswitch" feature for restarting on the fly - 
switching between the GTK* and Qt interfaces from within the Preferences GUI!
(*the GTK interface will be whichever GTK (2 or 3) Fauxdacious was compiled 
with).  

NOTE:  Fauxdacious must also have been compiled with both the Qt and one of the 
GTK interfaces.  Unlike Audacious, the Preferences window tells you which GTK 
(2 or 3) interface you're using or can switch to.  This involved significant 
restructuring the SDL (video-window) code to work properly between the two 
interfaces across restarts, making this more complicated to do than it was 
in Audacious.

NOTE2:  Previous default mode (if -Q or --qt) flag not specified was to start in 
GTK mode, however as a result of this merge, the default startup mode is now 
whatever mode Fauxdacious was in when exited.  Therefore, now one should 
generally start Fauxdacious using one of the flags (-Q or -G) to force the 
mode Fauxdacious will start up in.

* Switch version to v4.3-beta1 in keeping with Audacious's current release.

Version 4.2.2-beta1 (2/9/2023):

* Improved stability (more crash-proofing) due to numerous cleanups and 
refactoring of older and suspicious code.

* Fixed more minor issues handling cached cover-art files, particularly ones 
with odd characters in their names.

# Merged all applicable Audacious commits since last Fauxdacious final release 
through 2/9/2023.

* Add [Settings].[Song Info].(Fauxdacious Extras)[]"Don't Embed images in tags" 
checkbox option.  Normally when editing and saving song info (for local song 
files), when the user adds a file-URI to the Comment: field, Fauxdacious first 
attempts to store the image data in the file's metatags (along with any other 
changed tag data).  This will make the cover-art image visible in many other 
media players, but will usually significantly increase the file's size, which 
some may find undesirable.  If this option box is checked the image data will 
not be stored embedded in the file's metatags, but the art-file's URI will 
remain in the Comment field; and (if the [Save unsavable metadata to file] box 
is checked) the metadata will be stored in the desired Fauxdacious tag-file.  
The default is (unchecked) to save the image with the other tag data directly 
to the file (if possible) as previously (if not then to the tag-file).

Add --enable-gtk3 option to build with GTK-3 and update all code to support 
both GTK-2 and GTK-3, due to the planned phaseout of GTK-2 support by most 
distros.

Add hack for flac plugin to check and reject "bad" flac-wrapped ogg streams 
with incorrectly-formatted metadata that results in a seemingly endless 
(and fruitless) search for metadata when probing causing display "hangs".

Fix bug in ffaudio plugin that wrongly updated the playing entry's metadata 
when probing an entry other than the currently-playing one and icy metadata 
was found.  This dates back to the Aug 12, 2022 commit# ebd614d.

Version 4.2.1-final:

This version should be up to date with (and ahead of) Audacious's GIT commits 
through at least 11/01/22 (Audacious v4.3-devel), excluding namely the 
expansion of Audacious' reading playlist file buffer above 16 MB (Aud. Feature 
#1194) because I don't think this is necessary at this time.  We also left the 
GTK "alarm" plugin in for now (that they removed).  

The changes in this release are minor, primarily small features involving new 
Audacious metadata fields, cover-art handling, new "Search and Select" Playlist 
feature (improved and now in all interfaces), and more efficient handling of 
cached cover-art images.  This version also supports the latest StreamFinder 
(v2.01 - compiled into the M$-Windows versions of the helper scripts) which has 
added support for additional radio-station websites (internet-radio.com, 
onlineradiobox.com, and rcast.net)!  This seems like a good point for a new 
final release due to a lull in development activity both here and at Audacious 
of late, along with the opportunity to make StreamFinder v2.0 available to 
M$-Windows users.

Change log:

* Handle (parse) metadata from streaming internet stations that are formatted 
as "artist - title - album - genre".

* Add internet-radio.com and onlineradiobox.com to StreamFinder making many new 
internet radio-stations (many commercial-free) available for direct-streaming 
in Fauxdacious (Users must upgrade to StreamFinder v2.0).

* Add file-matching option by Artist for One-off streams (ie. videos and 
podcasts) to specify a channel-icon for those from frequently-accessed channel 
creators known to not have one (Rumble has become known for this issue).  
While at it, discovered and fixed a complex issue with "Duplicate-art hiding" 
on the GTK side involving podcasts, etc. where sometimes album-images would 
also show when no channel icon was available, or vice-versa (I continue to try 
my best to keep the GTK side fully supported, even though I don't use it much 
anymore).  The GTK side also seems alot more stable, just not quite as pretty!

* Add several new metadata fields Audacious recently added, but also make 'em 
each work properly with all codecs which support them and editable via the 
Song-Edit screen.  Fields are:  Publisher, Performer, Composer, and Catalog#.  
The GTK Song-Edit screen has room so the headers now show which codecs support 
fields (savability) which have limited codec support (Not room in the Qt vsn).

* Merge Audacious's skins-GTK "Search and Select" dialog into all interfaces, 
and add a "Jump right to it" checkbox to cause the first entry found to play.  
This option is needed if wishing to play the selected list, as double-clicking 
on one of the selected entries always clears the selections!

NOTE1:  "Jump right to it" does not apply if the "copy to new playlist" option 
is also selected (one can simply select the play option in that playlist to 
jump to it without clearing the selections in the original playlist).

NOTE2:  This option works well in tandum with the Fauxdacious 
[Settings].[Playlist]."[] Advance to next selected entry in list" option to 
play the selected list once, then resume normal play!

* Add [Settings].[Song Info] "Search for images in album-art cache" to enable 
pulling previously-cached (by the AlbumArt plugins) to be immediately loaded 
without calling the helper for local song files.  The main side-effect 
(besides speed) is that the cover-art image is immediately loaded without 
calling the CoverArtHelper script (just as if the image was in a file matching 
the song file-name itself, thus allowing for it to appear in the info-bar / 
Mini-Fauxdacious plugins.

While at it, we also added this code to the AlbumArt plugins to enable them 
to also check the cache directly without having to call the helper script 
(increases speed and efficiency).  NOTE:  When using the AlbumArt plugins, the 
new option is ignored, as the AlbumArt plugins are *supposed* to always check 
the AlbumArt cache first!

Version 4.2-final:

This version should be up to date with (and ahead of) Audacious's recent v4.2 
(final) release plus all accepted Audacious GIT commits through at least   
09/10/22.  This release features numerous minor changes all over.  We also 
updated all the Transifex translations to make Fauxdacious easier to use for 
non-English speakers.  

The Album-art plugins saw alot of attention, along with streaming metadata 
handling.  Several new playlist, menu and appearance options were added, along 
with a new "-a" command-line option.  Qt saw new theme and icon options.  
The Song Info Edit window in particular saw significant improvements.  

The Mini-Fauxdacious / info-bar code received significant cleanups reducing the 
potential for crashes, particularly on the Qt side.  Otherwise, just numerous 
minor bug-fixes, tweaks, stability improvements, and minor Audacious changes 
all over!  See the GIT commits for specific details.  We've had to release 
more v4.1.x-final versions while awaiting Audacious to release v4.2, 
as I prefer to avoid getting ahead of them in version numbers, even as we are 
ahead of 'em in features! ;)

M$-Windows users should see some improved functioning of the helper scripts.

NOTE:  As always, "final" does NOT mean the final (last) release we'll do, but 
rather the latest final (ie. finished) production release, as opposed to a 
beta or development ("devel") release (and a fresh MS-Windows binary build)!  

Change log:

* Update Transifex language-translations!

* Added new Song Info options:  "Directory Channel-icon file[.ext]" and 
"Use Directory Channel icon file (see above)" checkbox to allow 
specifying an image file-name, which, if it appears in the directory of a 
local song-entry file, will be used as the second ("channel") icon, similar 
to the station / video or podcast channel icon imported when playing them, if 
the Album-art plugin is active.  If not, and the song-entry does not have a 
cover-art image associated with it, this will instead be used as a "fallback" 
image for that entry.  The file-name specified may either be a simple name, 
such as "channel", in which Fauxdacious will check for either "channel.png", 
"channel.jp[e]g", or "channel.gif".  If specified with an extension, ie. 
"channel.png", then only that image file will be checked for.  The same file-
name must be used in all directories one wishes to have a channel icon, though 
the extensions may vary (unless specified), and of course they can be different 
images.  This differs from the other Album cover art file options, as it is 
not loaded/used until after any web-searches by the Album-art plugins.

* Added the Settings submenu option to the main menu for easier (2-click) 
access, along with some additional menu icons.

* Song-Info Edit window - Merge Audacious window-layout improvements allowing 
user to resize window where the input text fields expand with the window while 
keeping the image the same size.  Also allowing user to select the text of the 
song entry path (on the middle left side of the window)  We also added these 
features to the GTK version and increased the cover-art image size from 2 to 
2.5 inches for easier viewing.

* Fixed failure to play some URLs that contain playlists and have a valid 
playlist extension (ie. .pls, .m3u, etc.) by NOT calling the URL-helper script 
if this is so.  Also added an option to the [Settings.Playlist] tab to limit 
the number of entries added by such URL-based (web-based) playlists, many of 
which are just multiple entries for the same streaming station but with just 
different port numbers (streamtheworld.com has a lot of these).

* Album-art plugins - Add "Try to save by song file-name first?" option:  
This works like the same option that already exists in the Lyrics plugins, 
which (for local song files) causes web-fetched art image to be cached in the 
same directory and file-name as the song file itself exists in, but with any 
extension (ie. .mp3, etc., if any) to be replaced with the image type's 
extension.  Normally, cover-art images are placed in the 
.config/fauxdacious[-instancename]/albumart/ directory named after the album/
artist name.  This is useful for tying the image directly to the particular 
song file, which is where Fauxdacious looks first (if no embedded image tag).  
NOTE:  This option has no effect on cover-art downloaded by URL entries (ie. 
streaming stations, podcasts, videos, etc.)

* Album-art plugins - Ignore the "Hide info bar art icon unless separate album 
cover fetched" option when the Mini-Fauxdacious plugin is running and is not 
docked (floating).  The purpose of this option was to prevent displaying the 
same image in two places in the main window at once.  However, when running the 
Mini-Fauxdacious plugin undocked (it's own separate window), that most users' 
intent is to hide the main window thus hiding the duplicate image.  Therefore, 
we've added code to ignore the hide duplicates option when Mini-Fauxdacious is 
running undocked from the main window.  

* Merge Audacious's new alternate "dark theme" and "flat" icons.  We also 
added additional options in the [File].[Settings].[Appearance] tab to include 
both a GUI checkbox for the old option to use Fauxdacious's "classic" icons for 
the icons atop the [File].[Settings] window (previously had to be set in the 
config file), plus an option to choose between "Native" and "Qt"'s version of 
file-chooser windows.  This was needed due to the tradeoff of "Native" window 
style being generally preferred (more native platform-looking and 
full-featured), but ignoring user-set alternate themes and icons (such as the 
ones we just added).  Audacious just uses the OS-Native ones always, resulting 
in those windows NOT being rethemed, so we leave it to the user to choose.  
There are 3 choices:  "Native" (the default, like Audacious), "Native unless 
alt. theme or icons" (use Qt's less-featured version only if theme or icon 
theme are set to non-"Native" options; and "Qt" (use Qt's version always).  

* Add command-line option (-a) to load command-line entries to be loaded into 
multiple playlists.  The long-name is "--add-list".  For example:

$>fauxdacious [-other_options] entry1 entry2 -a entry3 entry4

-OR-

$>fauxdacious [-other_options] entry1 entry2 --add-list entry3 entry4

-OR-

$>fauxdacious [-other_options] entry1 entry2 --add-list="pl. name" entry3 entry4

This command would (depending on other playlist options) add entry1 and entry2 
to the current (or a new "Now Playing") playlist, then create a new separate 
"New Playlist" playlist and load entry3 and entry4 into it.  A trailing "-a" 
(with no entries following it) will add an extra blank playlist tab.  Each new 
playlist created will have the default name "New Playlist".

NOTE:  Unlike other options, this one is "standalone" (must always be preceeded 
by it's own dash ("-")), and can be used multiple times in the same command.

NOTE2:  If using the long form of the option, you can optionally include an 
argument specifying a playlist name to use (the default is "New Playlist").  
This optional name is a default, but if the next entry is a playlist file 
containing a playlist title, then that will override any name specified here, 
as is normal when importing playlist files.  

* Media format-probing:  Add/Fix handling of non-Vorbis data "wrapped" in ogg 
files/streams (ones with .ogg extension or "*/ogg" mimetypes).  This addresses 
both Audacious issues #1160 (embedded Flac) and #1176 (embedded Opus, et. al.).

* Fix bug related to user-editing of meta-tag data from streams downloaded as 
temporary playlists (in "tmp_tag_data" file).  The edits are saved in the 
"user_tag_data" global tag file, but the old values in tmp_tag_data still 
override the new values, so now upon successful edit, any corresponding entry 
in tmp_tag_data is now removed and the new values should now be displayed.

* Stream metadata:  Add Genre to icy-metadata returned from many streams.

* Playlist metadata:  Add two new options under [File].[Settings].[Playlist] 
tab (Fauxdacious Extras):  [] Keep playlist metadata (like cuesheets do); and 
[] Don't allow streams to change metadata.  Previously, when a metadata-
supporting playlist was added to Fauxdacious, the metadata for each entry would 
be overwritten by what was embedded in the file or stream, or with what was 
found in user tag files.  The first option (if checked) prevents this and keeps 
the entrie's metadata provided from the playlist.  This has always been the 
behaviour of multi-entry (playlist-like) cuesheets.  Unlike cuesheets, any 
metadata fields found in the entry or user tag files but omitted from the 
playlist metadata will still be filled in.  Note, when streaming online radio 
stations (which dynamically change the metadata when the streaming song 
changes) will still override the original playlist-provided metadata (usually 
desirable).  Check the second new option to also prevent this and maintain 
display of the playlist-set metadata for all entries.  

NOTE, that changing metadata fields via the Song Info. edit screen WILL still 
override whatever was set regardless, and blanking a field will either restore 
it to it's "fallback" value (if any, ie. filename for the Title field) or blank 
it out.

NOTE2:  The "Playlist.Refresh" and "Refresh Selected" options no longer really 
do anything as this is all handled properly now when an entry is added, loaded 
for play, scanned, or edited.  

NOTE3:  We also fixed editing to also update immediately even if the 
[File].[Settings].[Advanced] tab option "Do not load metadata for songs until 
played" option is checked.

* Fix apparently long-standing failure of the cover-art system to load cover-
art files specified in user tag files when "OVERRIDE" or "ONLY" precedence was 
set and cover-art was found embedded in the entry due to changes I believe 
occured under the Nov. 13, 2020 commit entitled "Fix ancient minor bug handling 
user tag files:" which I neglected to make a similar, needed change here.  This 
should also result in the highest priority cover-art image found in tag files 
being used if multiple matching tag-files are found using different precedences.

* Album Art plugins:  Fix bug that caused wrong album art image to be displayed 
for song files that did not have valid album art.  Problem only ocurred when 
playing a stream with an embedded cover art image url and the user jumped 
directly to play a song *file* that had no cover art image associated for it 
and the image for the previously-playing stream would be used due to a failure 
by the helper thread to properly and timely clear an internal variable.
Fixed by re-clearing in main thread portion of the plugins.

* Mini-Fauxdacious plugin (Qt):  Fix occasional failure to restore the infobar 
when the plugin is deactivated.

* Mini-Fauxdacious plugin (GTK):  Do not set initial undocked window as 
"transient" so that the plugin window in the M$-Windows version will not be 
minimized when the main window is (all other dockable plugins will continue to 
default to transient).  The other side-effect of transient windows is that they 
also remain on top of the main window (in most window-managers).  To make any 
undocked plugin window NOT transient, simply select "Undock" from the menu 
(even if it's already undocked), as the transient flag is only set when the 
window is first created undocked.

* DVD plugin:  Fix bug that still occasionally failed to terminate the reader 
thread when the user pressed the [Stop (play)] button.

* Neon transport plugin:  Check for user pressage of the [Stop (play)] button 
whilst waiting to connect to a streaming server, stop trying, and clean up.  
Problem was that if the server took many tries and or a long time to connect, 
Fauxdacious would just display "Buffering...", user could get tired of waiting, 
stop play at the "wrong" moment" and leave the reader thread still running in 
the background while the user attempted to play another entry, which would 
either crash Fauxdacious or also become hung in "infinite Buffering" until 
Fauxdacious was shut down and restarted.  We used our new "hook" we created for 
the recent DVD "audio-less menu" stop fix to handle this case as well.

Version 4.1.3-final:

This version should be up to date with Audacious's recent v4.1-beta1 release.  
Otherwise, Audacious development has been very slow & quiet of late.  All users 
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, and it is reccomended to update 
to and build with their distro's latest FFmpeg version.  This release brings 
a shiny new plugin ("mini-Fauxdacious"), improvements to several Fauxdacious 
features, the most recent Audacious changes, and improved stability.  
Video-playing sees better memory-managemt.  It's otherwise mostly a polish and 
maintenance release.  

NOTE:  As always, "final" does NOT mean the final (last) release we'll do, but 
rather the latest final (ie. finished) production release, as opposed to a 
beta or development ("devel") release (and a fresh MS-Windows binary build)!  

Change log:

* Numerous minor tweaks and fixes to the DVD plugin as we found a few issues 
(bugs) while testing out the FFmpeg function changes mentioned below.  The 
most serious of these was due to recent FFmpeg versions now returning ERROR 
instead of the separate EOF value when reading packets hits the end of a menu 
channel.  A second issue has been somewhat long-standing that there was no 
graceful way to shut down Fauxdacious when it was "stuck" in a silent menu 
awaiting user input (without first pressing a menu button to "play", then 
pressing the "Stop" button).  I determined to fix this whilst at it.  The 
other issues involved the Windows version and the fifo pipe not always being 
shut down and becoming unusable (requiring editing the config file and 
changing the pipe name).  It now properly closes on exit (unless a crash 
occurs) and uses a random name to eliminate reuse.  These issues and testing 
delayed this release by several days.  FFAudio seems to be working fine.  
Only fix needed there was a small memory leak.

* Refactor ffaudio and DVD plugins to replace FFmpeg-depreciated API functions.
Whilst at it, plug a significant memory-leak that had crept into the ffaudio 
plugin.  WARNING:  Most likely breaks backward-compatability w/significantly 
older libav/FFMpeg versions due to the the significant refactoring needed to 
cope with the modern FFmpeg API, but building w/"ffmpeg=libav" still seems 
to build if modern enough though (primarily due to the fact that FFMpeg now 
returns a pointer to initialize AVPackets instead of the data).

* Fix Fauxdacious not stopping play properly (being left stuck "buffering" and 
requiring a "kill" command from the command line) when an audio-less DVD menu 
is displayed and waiting for user-input (user had to select a play option in 
the menu to start play, then press the [Stop (play)] button to properly stop 
DVD play).

* Refactor stream metadata processing:  1) Handle cases of 
'title=".." artist=".."...'.  2) Fix minor issues when option to split 
title/artist fields NOT in effect (I always use the option, so hadn't gotten 
enough testing love with it off)!  3) Better emulate Audacious's handling of 
empty album field using stream domain-name; and we move it to the albumartist 
field when splitting title/artist.  4) try harder to catch cover-art embedded 
in metadata.  5) Be more consistant, especially if user toggles the split 
title/artist option after a playlist has been loaded (update metadata fields 
to the proper arrangement for the option on next metadata change).

* Merge Audacious's update to the Qt popup error message window so that when 
multiple errors occur, they are now displayed in a single popup window, now 
requiring a single acknowledgment (the popup window is modal).

* Merge Audacious's titlebar text dimming on focus-out on the Skins-Qt 
interface windows.

- One notable Audacious enhancement omitted is the addition of the "Moonstone" 
interface plugin - WITHHELD for now from Fauxdacious due to it's lack of an 
option or Settings menu access button to switch back out of it - requiring 
the user to close down and manually edit their config file to get back to 
the previous interface - YUCK!  I have not had time to try to add such an 
option to it due to it's code-reusage.  Also, our new "Mini-Fauxdacious" 
plugin provides a better alternative anyway (for both Qt and Gtk), imho!

* Several other minor bug-fixes and cleanups.

Version 4.1.3-beta2:

* Add "Mini-Fauxdacious" plugin (info-bar-plugin-qt) to address Audacious 
feature request# 1116.  This creates a standalone dockable version of the 
"info bar" embedded in the lower part of the main window (non-skinned Qt 
version).  When this plugin is invoked, if the embedded version of the info-
bar is visible, it becomes hidden, extending the number of playlist entries 
that are visible.  The user can then minimize the main window so that they 
effectively have a "mini" version of Fauxdacious.  The playlist keyboard 
shortcuts along with volume controls were added allowing basic play-
minipulation from this mini-window while the main-window is hidden.  This 
window can also be docked (either top of bottom) replacing the embedded 
version, but unlike it, the docked plugin will fill the width of the main 
window when docked.  I have not been able to remove the Qt-provided titlebar 
though.  

* Add GTK version of Mini-Fauxdacious plugin (info-bar-plugin-gtk).  NOTE:  
Unlike the Qt version, it is not possible to display both the classic info-
bar and this plugin at the same time (due to the GTK version not being fully 
object-oriented code, thus not possible to have more than one instance active!
(Both plugins auto-hide the classic info-bar when plugin is activated, and 
restore it (if previously not hidden) on deactivation (as this should be the 
preferred appearance, and you can dock the plugin anyway - top or bottom).

* Added a tool-tip balloon to both on hover to show the valid key-actions 
possible from within Mini-Fauxdacious.

* Add Albumart (plugins) option to also scale images UP to fill the size of 
the containing widget to address Audacious forum request dated 09/17/21.  
This option will apply to all GTK art icons/images and Qt ones in the 
Albumart-Qt plugin (GTK uses central code to scale images, but Qt does it in 
the Albumart plugin itself, and perhaps info-area, et. al.), but those are 
all small enough that it's pbly not worth bothering there!  *dacious already 
scale (too large) images DOWN to fit automaticly, but not UP.

Version 4.1.3-beta1:

* Add Playlist Settings Checkbox "Advance to next selected entry in list":
Fauxdacious has long had the extra feature for selecting a song other than 
the currently-playing one, and Fauxdacious would play that song next, but only 
the first one (if more than one) selected, and would not wrap back around 
unless the [Repeat] option was on.  1)  Fixed that to ignore the [Repeat] 
option and wrap if needed.  2a)  Fix Fauxdacious to NOT clear the selection 
list (but only deselect the previously-playing song) on song-advance/jump, and 
2b)  Continue to advance throuogh multiple-selected songs in the playlist from 
starting with the first one below the currently-playing entry from top to 
bottom order, wrapping as necessarily and deselecting each one after play.  
This allows for one-off overriding the current play order, and is particularly 
useful while using the [shuffle] option, as it overrides that too until only 
the currently-playing song is selected (highlighted), then reverts to normal 
play ([shuffle], [repeat] options, or next song).  The new checkbox previously 
mentioned must be checked for #2a and #2b to apply, otherwise, the default is 
to work as previous Fauxdacious versions (and Audacious) work (selected songs 
are deselected (row highlight removed)), except #1 still applies.

NOTE:  This only affects advancing to the [Next >>|] song, as this traversal is 
always one-way, deselecting each after play, so the [Previous |<<] button still 
behaves as always, moving either the previous song (or previous shuffle(d) 
song) played, but selections remain highlighted and resume from there until 
all but the currently-playing song entry are deselected (dehighlighted).

* Add support for a second "art icon" for the album/video/podcast channel/ 
audio CD-disk to be displayed in the song-info section when the Album Art 
plugin is active and displaying a different (video/podcast/CD track-specific) 
image.  This is supported in the "Comment" metadata field - to add the second 
(album artist icon) image file, append a semicolon followed by the file URI, 
ie. "Comment=file:///path/CoverArtImageFile;file:///path/albumArtistIconFile". 
This works similar to the separate song album-cover art and the streaming 
station icon feature we added awhile back.  The Song-Info edit screen 
"Art Lookup" feature will only replace the first file, if any (before the 
semicolon) leaving that second album-artist image link intact.

* Add support for embedded lyric tags to APE tags (wavpack plugin), Vorbis 
comments (flac, vorbis plugins) and for formats handled by FFMpeg via the 
ffaudio plugin, such as opus, ogv, etc.  Fetching these embedded lyrics tags 
should now be supported for all file formats the underlying plugins' upstream 
libraries do, but saving lyrics to embedded tags is limited to files with the 
following extensions for now:  .mp3, .ogg, .ogm, .oga, .flac, .fla, and .wv.

* Add a user-agent config option and an option to completely ignore SSL 
certificate checking/verification to the neon transport plugin to deal with 
fussy streams.

* Fix and improve track metadata handling for Audio-CDs, particularly 
when using custom disk-specific tag files.

* Merge in (most of) recent Audacious commits and fixes (see GIT commits).

* Fix several misc. minor bugs (see GIT commits for details).

Version 4.1.2-final

This release is a smaller release than previous ones (much fewer changes) as 
Fauxdacious has somewhat matured and Audacious development has greatly 
slowed.  Most of the changes center around improving efficiency and smoother 
user experience, particularly by threading calls to the helper scripts out 
from the main GUI thread.  Most of the changes this release involved the 
Lyricwiki and Albumart plugins and their associated helper scripts.  Besides 
user-experience, much of the efficiency improvements involved significant 
effort to minimize the number of "hits" placed against websites providing 
album-art images and / or lyrics when playing streaming radio stations that 
change songs every few minutes.  Besides speed, this effort is directed at 
lowering the risk of a user who frequently listens to such stations using 
these plugins from getting noticed and possibly blocked by any of these 
websites for "overusage".  Anyway, all users are encouraged to upgrade to 
v4.1.2-final as soon as practical!  

NOTE:  There appears to be a bug in recent versions of libtasn (upstream 
library) that can in rare cases crash Fauxdacious when user jumps from a 
playing fixed-length https stream to another stream while freeing 
certificate data when the previous connection is closed (freed).  We added 
an attempt to the Neon plugin to use a Try/Catch fuse on the offending 
function call that frees the session.  This might lead to a possible memory-
leak but not much else.  Due to the rarity of this bug, I haven't been able 
to thoroughly test the work-around.

Detailed changelog below:

* I believe that the recent threading improvements seemed to have eliminated 
the long-standing bug involving the skins-GTK interface sometimes becoming 
unresponsive to user-interaction (mostly the Windows version), as I haven't 
seen this manifest in quite some time now.

* Remove confirmation popup when deleting an empty playlist.  Just seemed 
somewhat annoying and silly to me when the playlist is empty, and There's 
already a user-option to turn this off anyway, but perhaps now fewer users 
will be inclined to turn it off.  

* Refactor CoverArtHelper script to take advantage of the latest v1.20 of 
LyricFinder's ability to fetch a cover art image from some lyrics sites, and 
also reduce hits on the lyrics sites by fetching lyrics along with the cover 
art image, and integrating with the LyricWiki plugin to avoid having to re-
call the lyric site furnishing the cover art image for lyrics (when both 
plugins are active.  Also fix failure of Musicbrainz to return cover art 
images due to slight changes in their site.  The CoverArtHelper will now first 
try the LyricFinder module for cover art (and lyrics), then, failing that, 
will try to fetch from Musicbrainz (previously it always hit Genius.com 
(one of the "lyrics" sites) first), then Musicbrainz.

NOTE:  As a result, users must upgrade LyricFinder to v. 1.20 or better to 
take advantage of this integration!

* Greatly improve the GUI performance and overall efficiency when using the 
AlbumArt and/or Lyric plugins by separating out to separate threads, the 
calling of their respective Perl helper scripts for fetching cover-art and 
lyrics respectively from the web (The GUI should no longer briefly "freeze" 
while the helper script(s) are searching for and fetching data from the web!

* Refactor the FFMpeg plugin for better video playing via a separate reader-
thread to fill the buffer queues and redo the way the queueing takes place.  
This slightly improves video play in general and greatly improves HLS videos 
(m3u8 and mpd).  Also add option to specify that these "dash"-style videos 
(or any other based on user-choice) be handled by FFMpeg itself rather than 
by the Neon transport plugin.

* Add ability to use cover-art links embedded in ICY metadata tags or 
specified in the "StreamURL" metadata field for streaming radio stations, 
saving the need to search the web for the Title and Album fields (when using 
the Cover Art plugins.

* Add ability to play flac streams w/embedded ogg-vorbis (addresses Audacious 
support/feature request# 1075).

* Add threading to the lyricwiki plugins to move the lyric-fetching from the 
web (the helper script), which is slow so that the gui is not temporarily 
frozen whilst fetching lyrics from the web.

* Add "Hide Info Bar Fallback Art" (View option) to only show an icon in the 
info bar shown for the currently-playing entry only if there actually is one 
(like the info popup currently works).

* Apply the (Fauxdacious-only) "Split Artist - Title in streams" option to 
Vorbis comments (ogg-based streams), which may use vorbis-comments instead of 
icy to embed metadata.

Version 4.1.1-final

This version adds several minor features and numerous minor tweaks and fixes, 
particularly for users using multiple playlist tabs, the LyricWiki plugin, and 
the Qt plugins.  Audacious came out of hybernation just after v4.1-final was 
released and did a ton of retooling under the hood, and we have merged (most) 
of them here (Audacious v4.1-beta1 commits from Dec. 7 through Jan. 7 2021).  
We are now "ahead" version-number wise of Audacious due to our release 
schedule and numerous Fauxdacious commits of late and their unexpected delay 
in releasing a final 4.1 before we needed a final release).

Short log:

* Fix playlist-tabs to work properly (make deleted tabs disappear, allow 
keyboard focus/minipulation, remove sort-indicators on column headers when 
multiple tabs are shown (to avoid confusion due to the fact that different 
tabs can be sorted by different columns, but can not display different sort 
indicators per column due to Audacious design (Audacious does not support 
column sort indicators!)).  Added [Import] and [Add Files] menu options to 
playlist tabs for convenience.

* Numerous Audacious retooling and rewiring under the hood changes merged.

* Fix several window-manager issues.

* Merge Audacious's new "dock-window" interface for Qt plugin windows.

* LyricWiki plugin improvements, namely better caching and restoring lyrics, 
and displaying "description" text for podcasts and videos in Lyricwiki in 
lieu of song lyrics (since they don't have "lyrics", but a "description".

* Helper plugins can now be user-configured more easily via new corresponding 
".ini" files (templates included for users to edit to their requirements).

* Doc / FAQ improvements, particularly how to properly install and test the 
three Perl "helper" scripts, and get them working after I had to walk a user 
through that process after he attempted to install them by following the docs.

To-do (next release):

* Make the "About" window not "always-on-top".

* Remove "LWP::Simple" from FauxdaciousUrlHelper.pl's prerequesite Perl 
modules (no longer needed).

Version 4.1.1-beta2

Lyrics - Added "Album" field to argument list passed to the Lyric Helper 
script, and modified the script to enable skipping specific "albums" from 
trying to fetch lyrics.  This makes it possible to prevent streaming 
stations (very few change the Album field) that play say, instramental 
music, etc. that don't have lyrics, from uselessly hitting the lyrics 
sites for lyrics without having to close the LyricWiki plugin down.

Switched the lyric helper and plugins to now use my new LyricFinder CPAN 
module instead of the much-older Lyrics::Fetcher::* modules maintained by 
David Precious.  This makes installation much easier as all the supported 
side modules are now bundled together!  We also added some new features, and 
we now have full contol over updates / maintenance!

Version 4.1.1-beta1

I now believe that v4.1-final was slightly rushed (should've released a 
4.1-beta4 in hindsight), as (is typical) when the dust settled, I thought 
of a cpl. (minor, I thought) features to add for the next release that ended 
up resulting in a bunch of testing and revealed (or created) issues (bugs) 
that needed fixing!  Therefore, with Audacious development seeming to be 
in hibernation at the moment, I want to get all this out into an eventual 
v4.1.1-final eventually (before Audacious wakes back up), then maybe pause 
myself for a while.  We're also waiting on the Lyrics::Fetcher developer to 
merge our changes into his code.  Anyway, go apply those commits and test! ;)

FIXED:

* Minor issue with Albumart's "Hide info bar art icon unless separate 
album cover fetched" option that caused non-"dup" (internet-fetched) 
album-art to still show in info bar when [View].[Show Info Bar Album Art] 
was unchecked (hide always).

* Url Helper script:  Handle non-ascii characters that come from a few 
websites via StreamFinder in the description text, and possibly the title, 
that don't play nice with Glib's g_key_file_get_string () function, which is 
used to fetch this data from the tag files.

* CDs/DVDs: (LyricWiki) - Make LyricWiki plugin's [Save Locally] button 
work correctly for disks when the [Try to save by song file-name first] 
option is set.

* CDs/DVDs: Fix some issues involving updating & saving tag metadata via 
the [Song Info] screen, and harden the code to prevent potential crashes 
if the disk has no disk-ID / title.  For CDs, track metadata can be fetched 
from the disk (cdda) or from the web (cddb, or the (cover art) helper script 
the first time a disk is played.  We save any such fetched track data in 
a custom tag file (~/.config/Fauxdacious[-instancename]/<DISK-ID>.tag), if 
the plugin option "Allow Custom Tag-files" is checked, so that on subsequent 
play, the data is already saved locally.  Users can modify this data for 
individual tracks using the [Song Info] box, as is true for other music 
files.  For DVDs, only cover art is fetched, but the displayed title and 
cover art image can be changed, artist, year, etc. can be added the same way.

* neon: Add workaround for frequent 416-server errors that seem to plague 
some podcast sites that cause podcasts to seemingly randomly fail to start.  
(The server reports that it can accept byte range offsets for seeking, then 
will sometimes return a 416 error when we attempt to seek to get metadata.  
Retrying startup (this workaround) without seeking seems to work!

* cover art: The new [Song Info]."Search for images matching Album tag..." 
option was being overridden by the first image found matching the keyword 
search feature, if both were found.  Fixed to ensure precedence (when all 
search options are enabled) is:  1) art image file matching the song entry's 
file name (ie. song.png for song.mp3); 2) Album name image (ie. Album Name.jpg 
if the Album tag is "Album Name", and then 3) "*<keyword>*" (ie. "*cover*.png", 
"*album*.jpg", etc. searched recursively down thru the subdirectories.

* Lyrics: Null-terminate lyrics to avoid trailing "garbage characters" showing 
up at the bottom of the lyrics display screen.

* ogg/vorbis: Only allow "streams", not song files of this type to update 
(change) the tag metadata (from what was probed) when playback starts.  This 
now is consistant with mp3 files and streams.  Problem manifested when the 
user created a "user tag data" file entry for a song file with Precedence set 
to "ONLY" or "OVERRIDE" meaning use THESE values, then starting play would 
override these values with the metadata in the tags.  We WANT this for streams, 
ie. streaming radio stations that CHANGE titles, etc. regularly, but NOT for 
files, where the song metadata is fetched once on scan.

* user tag files: The "Precedence" field in these tag files was not working 
properly in certain cases, namely when a higher priority (more local) tag file, 
ie. "./user_tag_data.tag" had an "OVERRIDE" precedence, but a lower-priority 
tag file, ie. "fauxdacious/user_tag_data" had an "ONLY" precedence.  Now, the 
tag files are processed in proper order with only the FIRST matching entry 
used, and the song's metadata tags are read (and processed against "DEFAULT" 
or "OVERRIDE") unless the matching entry's precedence is "ONLY".  A new 
precedence option was added:  "NONE" means ignore the entry (as if commented 
out) and continue searching.  The priority is:  
1) "<fauxdacious-instance>/tmp_tag_data", 2) "./<song-file>.<mp3>.tag", 
3) "./user_tag_data.tag", 4) "<fauxdacious-instance>/user_tag_data", 
and 5) Tags embeded in the entry.  (Tags with precedence="DEFAULT" 
are overwritten by non-empty tag fields from the entry).

ADDED:

* Ability to hide album-art icon in info bar ([View].[Show Info Bar Album Art]) 
option and Albumart plugin's [Hide info bar art icon unless separate album 
cover fetched] options to the Gtk side (long ago added to Qt side) when 
Audacious added this to their Gtk side recently.

* Merged in recent Audacious changes, mostly cosmetic.  However, one big 
change was a redesign of their Qt plugin "dock windows", but also, the 
equalizer and the "queue manager".  This created some window-management 
issues due to the fact that Qt restores whatever active plugins you were 
running when you last exited, but also which plugin windows were "docked" or 
"undocked", and if "undocked", their window-locations on the screen.  This 
is great, but the way Qt handles this causes issues with many window-managers. 
Qt creates all the plugin windows slightly before mapping the main window, 
which thwarts window-managers' attempts to group all the windows with the main 
(master) window, since they often expect the master window to be mapped first.
The results were that the undocked dock windows started out in "limbo" being 
placed always on top of other application's windows, and not raising and 
lowering when the main window (the playlist window) was clicked on.  The only 
way to fix this was for the user to manually dock and then undock each of 
these windows.

We added a workaround config option: [audqt]."restore_floating_dockapps_late", 
and made it default: TRUE.  This option forces Fauxdacious-Qt to save a list 
of all plugins with undocked dock windows, and deactivate them on exit.  When 
restarted, the main window is first created with any (previously) docked 
plugins restarted first, then manually checks the list and restarts all the 
docked ones afterwards (this appears almost instantaniously to the user).  The 
only remaining issue is that I have been unable to get the main window to 
start out focused, but the last restored undocked plugin window has the 
keyboard focus (until user clickes on the main window).

We've now added a second workaround for this using window-managers' 
"FocusOnMap" options (for ones, such as AfterStep which allow app-specific 
window-management options) by changing the Qt application's "name" from 
"Fauxdacios" to "Fauxdacious_Qt" to differenciate it from the GTK interface, 
so that using the following AfterStep "database" config options, one can have 
this configured for the Qt plugin windows work properly, but still have the 
GTK version of the windows still work well too:

AfterStep database config options for best results with Fauxdacious (configure 
similar options on other WMs for this workaround).  This works because 
AfterStep looks at WM_NAME (window title), then WM_CLASS (application name) to 
match "Style"s, and applies matching one from first to last:

Style  "*"                 FocusOnMap
Style  "Fauxdacious_Qt"    NoFocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition, HonorGroupHints, HonorTransientHints, HonorExtWMHints
Style  "Fauxdacious_NF"    NoFocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition, HonorGroupHints, HonorTransientHints, HonorExtWMHints
Style  "* Fauxdacious"     FocusOnMap,   Sticky, HonorPPosition, HonorGroupHints, HonorTransientHints, HonorExtWMHints
Style  "*dacious Video"    Layer 0, NoFocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition
Style  "*dacious DVD"      FocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition
Style  "Mini-Fauxdacious*" NoTitle, NoFrame, NoHandles, Sticky, HonorPPosition, HonorGroupHints, HonorTransientHints, HonorExtWMHints
Style  "Fauxdacious"       FocusOnMap, Sticky, HonorPPosition, HonorGroupHints, HonorTransientHints, HonorExtWMHints

While at it, fixed GTK side to NOT put Equalizer window "AlwaysOnTop".

* Video Display (visualization plugin):  This plugin now works like all the 
other "visualization plugins", allowing the user to dynamically toggle the 
video window (for both the FFmpeg and the DVD plugins)!  Video is toggleable 
if the plugin's own existing [Play video in popup window] option is checked.  
Previously, the user had to stop and restart any currently-playing video 
stream in order for toggling this plugin to take effect.

NOTE:  When upgrading to this version from v4.1-final, you'll probably need 
to go into the FFmpeg and DVD plugins' configuration options screens and 
re-check the box for [Play video stream in popup window]!

* Made the [skins].afterstep configuration flag global and added an option 
box to the [Settings].[Advanced] screen labeled [Quirky window-managers 
(ie. AfterStep)?].  Users who had the old option set in their config file(s) 
will need to go and check this box!

* URL Helper:  Place the "Description" text from StreamFinder::* fetched URLs 
into the "Lyrics" tag (in the tag file).  This is very useful for videos and 
podcasts, as these almost never have matching "lyrics"!  However, for streaming 
radio stations that play songs, these "lyrics" will (properly) be overritten 
by those related to the currently-playing song title whenever the "title" 
field changes during play (as was before).  Some podcasts DO have embedded 
"lyrics"/description, and those also will overwrite this Description "lyrics" 
put into the tag file by the helper script.

Version 4.1-final

* LyricWiki plugins:  Add options to turn off internet lyric fetching, and 
to try first to save lyrics to song file name first (ie. "./songfile.lrc") as 
opposed to the global lyrics cache 
("~/.config/fauxdacious[-instancename]/lyrics/ARTIST NAME/TITLE.lrc").  This 
only affects songs playing from disk, as opposed to URLs, etc.

* LyricWiki plugins:  Save lyrics to the global lyrics cache directory as: 
"lyrics/ARTIST NAME/Title.lrc" instead of just title (lyrics/TITLE.lrc), like 
Audacious does.  This needed b/c there are songs with the same title by 
different artists that are completely different songs & different lyrics!

* Helpers:  Add a corresponding "helper-script-name.ini" file for each of the 
current 3 helper programs, ie. "FauxdaciousUrlHelper.ini".  Comments in the 
top of each of the templates (in /contrib/) describe what the user can 
configure.  This was previously hard-coded in the scripts, and Windows users, 
with no Perl on their systems and using the compiled binary versions had no 
way to edit.  NOTE:  Windows users will find this in the same directory the 
installer installed the program in 
(default is:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Fauxdacious\bin\) and will need to copy 
the ones they wish to edit to their (usually): 
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Fauxdacious[-instancename]\ directory.  
All others will need to copy them from the /contrib/ directory to the same 
place in order to edit and use.

* Skins:  Add "Add Files" and "Add URL" options to the main menu, making it 
easier to add stuff to the playlist without the playlist being displayed.

Version 4.1-beta3

* Add [Song Info] option to search for cover-art file name matching the 
Album tag (if specified).  This is only done if this new option is set AND 
there's an album tag AND no other cover art file was found.  The matching 
<Album-name>.{jpg|jpeg|png} file must be in the same directory as the song 
file (no recursive search is done).  Address Audacious bug# 1013.

* Add a "Hide info bar art icon unless separate album cover fetched" option 
to the Qt version of the Album Art plugin (I don't know how to program this 
in the GTK version yet).  This enhances the new Audacious [View]."Show info 
bar Album Art" option, which allows hiding the album-art icon in the playlist 
"info bar" (not the hover-over playlist info popup).  This new Fauxdacious 
option will still hide the info bar icon only when no custom album-art image 
is fetched from Musicbrainz (the web) for the currently-playing song.  The 
reason for this is that unless a custom album-art image is fetched from 
the web, the image shown in the Album Art plugin will be a *duplicate* of 
the icon shown in the info bar, which some may find redundant / annoying.
This is typically noticable when streaming radio stations with the Album Art 
plugin enabled and fetching images for each song, but not finding images for 
some, in which case the station icon will show in both places, but the user 
WANTS the station icon shown in the info bar only if there's a different 
(real album cover) found for the song.

* Add a true "visualization plugin" to toggle whether or not a video window 
will pop up when a video stream or DVD is played (Previously, the user went 
to the config options for those other two plugins to check the box if they 
wanted the video popup window to display).

* Add a Pure-Perl lyrics "helper" script (FauxdaciousLyricsHelper.pl) and 
update the LyricsWiki plugins to use the Perl helper script to fetch lyrics 
from sites supported by David Precious's Lyrics::Fetcher::* modules (on CPAN). 
Sites currently known to work:  genius.com, azlyrics.com, and musixmatch.com.  
This was all necessitated by the fact the lyricwiki (fandom.com) is now 
defunct, and Audacious rejected the last bug reporting that fact, implying to 
me that they may decide to depreciate the lyricwiki plugins.  NOTE:  if no 
helper script is specified, the lyricwiki plugins will still "work" the old 
way, so if Audacious does fix this, then it should work again without the 
helper script.  This should provide a longer-term fix, since as sites change 
and come and go, users should only need to update the Lyrics::Fetcher::* 
modules rather than having to update / recompile Fauxdacious.  Also, multiple 
lyrics sites can be searched as needed.  NOTE:  This is still "beta quality", 
as I'm working with David Precious's Lyrics::Fetcher::* modules to work better 
with Fauxdacious and better handle special case artist names and titles.

* Fix fetching cover-art images in files tagged as id3v2.2 
(Audacious bug# 1030).

* Add genius.com to the Cover Art helper script, as it provides much quicker 
and simpler searches, and contains a vast library of song-specific cover-art 
images.

Version 4.1-beta2

* Enable fetching and storing cover-art images in APE-tagged files 
(Wavpack/.wv files) and Vorbis-comment tagged files (.ogg), as was previously 
added for ID3v24 (.mp3) files.

* Fix potential bug (mostly affects M$-Windows users) where cue-sheet files 
named with upper case extention (".CUE") probably weren't being correctly 
recognized and handled as cue-sheets.

* Fix bug where adding an album cover image to a cue-sheet entry would 
clobber the cue-sheet file itself when being added via the Song-Info screen.  
Problem was the metadata was being saved to (over) the cue-sheet file itself 
instead of the selected entry.  Saving other metada to cue-sheet entries was 
already prohibited (except the art image).  Fixed by both correcting this 
bug AND now permitting user to edit the other metadata by making the song-info 
screen data user-editable for cue-sheet entries as well.  NOTE:  Metadata 
fields updated by the song-info screen are still OVERRIDDEN by any 
corresponding values specified in the cue-sheet file (even though the updated 
data is still saved and preserved in the referenced entry file)!

* Added audio channels data to the Song Info. plugin screen (Audacious-added 
feature), but for audio-CDs, we fetch the actual no. of channels instead of 
hardcoding to 2!

* Added option to hide the menu-row at the top of the Qt playlist window 
(Audacious-added feature).

* Added option to hide the cover-art icon and / or the visualization shown 
on the info-bar below the playlist on the Qt playlist window.

* Numerous other minor Audacious commits merged along with minor cleanups and 
optimizations of our own.

Version 4.1-beta1

Version 4.0-final has shown to be a very good release, stability-wise and 
is now pretty much doing everything I want it to do, however due to very 
little uptake (by others), I'm starting to lose interest in development.  
That said, I continue to monitor Audacious and what they're doing.  Since 
they've officially switched to Qt (and I only use GTK), very little of what 
they're doing interests me, however, they are still finding small bugs and 
optimizations, which I am continuing to merge here.  One issue is that they've 
been doing a titanic amount of work under the hood that would require 
immense labor on my part to merge into our now widely-different codesets that 
don't seem to actually improve functionality.  Some support some new Qt plugins 
/ features such as their searchtool plugin, and a new album-advance feature 
that I won't use or need.  Oh, never mind - Audacious has recently been 
rejecting some user-requests that I think are cool ideas, so it's gotten me 
busy again! :D

* One new fauxdacious-specific feature I have added to the StreamTuner plugin 
is grabbing image thumbnails for stations selected via StreamTuner and 
implementing using our "user_tag_data" custom tag-file.  This is for the 
IHeartRadio model only for now, as only that site has these image 
links in their metadata.  I would love to have the StreamTuner plugin 
available to me as a user, but Audacious does not plan to create a GTK 
version at this point and I do not have the skillset necessary to create one 
on my own.  I have also filed feature request# 969 to make streamtuner sorted 
and sortable, as this is also above my skill level.

* Fixed Qt time slider/display issues, closing Audacious bug# 957.

* Fixed segfault when using sox resampler at higher bitrate than song when 
adjusting the time slider (closes Audacious bug# 950).

* Merging various Audacious tweaks (mostly minor bugfixes and Qt changes).

* Added cover-art file-selector button to the "Song Info" window on the 
Qt side.  Also disabled the button on both sides when the [Settings].
[Song Info]."Save unsaveable metadata to (tag) file" option isn't checked, 
as fetching album art from the Tuple::Comment field ONLY works when it's 
in a tag file, NOT embedded in the song file's metadata!

* Merged a massive Audacious change to the "recording/dubbing" API from back 
in 2017, since some of our changes were causing seg-faults and needed these 
changes to work correctly.

* Added option to the Lyricwiki plugin to save fetched lyrics directly into 
the id3v24 tags in mp3 files (Audacious-rejected feature #977 and 
Audacious-ignored request #752).  

* Whilst I was at it, I also figured out how to save cover-art images 
directly into them as well, greatly reducing the need for large 
"user_tag_data" tag files and the need to keep all the album-art images 
stored forever on the albumart directory!  The requestor of #752 said he 
knew of only one Linux player that supported this, well, now there are TWO!

* Fixed issue of tag-saving during recording, which could cause an annoying 
"hiccup" in mp3 files.  The issue is that you really can't properly save 
id3 tags into a file whilst it's being recorded, so now we don't - instead, 
we just save to the "user_tag_data" tag files (if "save unsavable metadata" 
option is enabled), otherwise, we no longer attempt to save tag data while 
file is being recorded into.

* We now save the status and position of the Equalizer window in the non-
skinned interfaces (as is already the case in the skinned ones, addressing 
Audacious request #909.

* Added the plugins' actuall (short) "names" to the [Settings].[Plugins] 
window (enclosed in []) to make it easer to enable and disable plugins via 
the Fauxdtool (since it needs THAT name), as there is no other good way to 
get that name.  Someone requested this in Audacious a while back but I can't 
find it (and they haven't done it).

Version 4.0-final

Notable enhancements include:

* Custom song/stream-specific equalizer & effects-plugin settings added to 
the Qt version. including stream URLs.

* New option for the Album Art plugin for fetching album-art from MusicBrainz 
for the current song playing, including changing the album-art as the song 
title changes when playing from streams!

* Lyricwiki fixes and improvements, including the ability to save to and use 
local lyric files for songs.

* Enable tag-data saving while song is being recorded from a stream, including 
album-art.

* Add option for enabling separate custom tag-files for individual songs and 
directories (for local song files).

* New option to split the artist and title from icecast, et. al. streams 
which do not format them correctly.

* Improve Win32 building and build a new binary Win32 version of v4.0-final!

* Eliminate spam warning messages when exiting the Qt version!

* m3u8 tag improvements.

* Merge on more of Audacious's Qt interface fixes / improvements.

* numerous code optimizations and UI touchups!


Version 3.10-final

* Expose PauseMute option (-P option in Fauxdacious) to fauxdtool 
("--playback-pausemute 0|1" to set and "--playback-doespausemute" to 
fetch status - returned in $?).

* Fauxdacous is now completely divorced from Audacious!  This means that the 
two no longer share ANY library, include, binary, or configuration names, 
and one can now install both Fauxdacious and Audacious on the same 
system and even the same base directory location, ie. /usr/local/.  The 
common library names, such as libaudcore, libaudgui, etc have all been 
renamed libfauxdcore, libfauxdgui, etc.  User configurations are now 
kept separate under ~/.config/fauxdacous*/ instead of ~/.config/audacous*/.
Existing Fauxdacious / Audacious users will need to copy (cp -R) their 
existing configuration files over accordingly!  Users may also need to 
edit their "user_tag_data" files that reference images in the prev. config 
directory!  Manpages reflect the new (proper) names as well (fauxdacious 
and fauxdtool).
NOTE:  Within "config" files themselves, the secion "[audacious]" remains 
unchanged, so you shouldn't have to edit the file(s) themselves!

* Add "close when recording stopped" and "use custom (directory) for 
non-local directories" checkboxes to Filewriter.
The first causes stdout to be closed whenever recording stops (uncheck 
for multiple recordings to stdout).  The second prevents error if 
recording a streaming URL to "Orig. Directory" by saving the output to 
the "custom" directory ($HOME if custom directory field empty).

* Added option under [Settings].[Song Info] to set a "default" cover-art 
file for use by entries for which Fauxdacious can not find a cover-art 
image for.  Default: empty (no image).

* Replaced some very old and primitive C-code.

* Add checkbox for "PauseMute" (-P command-line option) to the 
[Settings].[Playlist] options screen (both GTK & QT) to allow toggling 
this option while running.  Changes are lost on restart as the -P option 
(or lack thereof) still sets the (default) state on startup (this is 
intentional).

* Make piping to stdout actually useful:  Add a -o / --out=<ext> command-
line option to force Fauxdacious to launch with the Filewriter plugin 
selected for output and temporarily configured to write to stdout.  This 
is then reset back to the original user-configured output plugin and 
recording options on exit.  If "headless" (-H option) is also specified, 
then "-q" (--quit-after-play) is also implied and Fauxdacious exits when 
playback stops.  This makes it easy to do conversion piping, 
like:  "fauxdacious -DcH --out=mp3 [stuff-to-play] >new_file.mp3" WITHOUT 
having to first start up, set the recording options to stdout, etc., exit, 
then run to pipe to stdout!  This option long ago existed in my earliest 
Audacious hacks but had since been removed when I remerged my changes to 
Audacious v3.6.  The supported extensions are:  wav, mp3, ogg, and flac.

* Had to (re)add a separate "--" stdin argument for loading a list 
of files EARLY (before fauxdacious can transfer itself to an existing 
running session) to restore the (apparently long-lost) ability to append 
additional files via stdin to a running session (also still works for 
new sessions too though).  Example:  "ls somefiles | fauxdacious -Dc --",
then, later: "ls somemorefiles | fauxdacious -e --".

* Added feature to stdin-piping to now allow the direct piping in of 
a text list of playlist entries WITHOUT the previously-required extension 
("-.m3u", "-.txt", etc.), but rather now just "-", same as when piping in 
media streams (but the old Fauxdacious way (with extensions) still works!)  
Fauxdacious supports two ways of stdin-piping due to the fact that this 
feature predates Audacious's current way of doing it.  The (non-probing) 
"old way" involves specifying the media type via extension, ie. 
"cat song.mp3 | fauxdacious -.mp3".  This (and the even older "stdin://-.mp3")
still work, even for piping in playlists or queuesheets.  The "new way" 
Audacious does it is without the extension ie. "cat song.mp3 | audacious -").
Fauxdacious now supports both methods for media, but still requires the 
matching extension hint for cuesheets and playlists (other than text/m3u), 
since the underlying Audacious code does no probing for playlists, and 
Audacious does NOT support piping in playlists or cue-sheet files anyway.
(In other words, if it works in Audacious, it should work in Fauxdacious!)
If the media type is known, the "old way" is still preferred as it tells 
Fauxdacious exactly what's coming in, and thus probing can be avoided!
NOTE:  .mov files (and perhaps some others that require seeking to the end 
of the file before playing), disks (CDs and DVDs), and streams that require 
transformation by the URL helper script such as Youtube, etc. can NOT 
be piped in via stdin!

* Cleaned up some issues with stdin-piping of adplug and ffmpeg media.
We now also open stdin as a VFS file when "Matched by extension" (the 
"old way") so as to work more like it now does when matching by content 
ie. when no extension is specified with the "-" (the "new way").

* Eliminated the now-depreciated "youtubedl" plugin.  This plugin was my 
rough first attempt at playing Youtube videos in Fauxdacious, but is now 
obsolete, as Youtube (and other) videos are now much better supported 
via the FauxdaciousURLHelper.pl "helper" script which uses the Perl library: 
StreamFinder::Youtube, and youtube-dl (the separate program).  Videos 
played via the youtubedl plugin were NOT even seekable, and ffaudio now 
has an option to save the video to a file while playing, thus fully 
eliminating the need for youtubedl!

* Added feature where if one selects a song in the playlist while another 
song is playing, advancing to the next song will jump directly to that song.

* Added "Random Skin on Play" option (Audacious. feature req# 755) to Winamp 
Skins interfaces (Gtk & QT) so that when set, the playlist advances, skin 
theme changes to random installed skin.  Also added new preference checkbox 
in [Settings].[Appearance] window to contol (Default: unchecked (false)).
NOTE:  Skin does NOT change when just song-title changes in streams.
Care was taken to ensure the same skin does not come up twice in a row.
Feature only happens if there are at least 2 skins installed.

* Set up configuration to install the new modern libadplug-based version 
of the AdPlug plugin (Audacious plugin commit# a39bfd7) BUT retain and 
rename the old Audacious-based local version to "AdPlug Classic" (audadplug) 
resulting in having BOTH the old and new versions installed due to some 
64 bit linux versions requiring a PATCH to libadplug that's not included 
on some distro's current package versions.  The patch prevents Fauxdacious 
from CRASHING whilst probing some streams - See Audacious bug# 759.  Since 
Debian Buster, in particular, has drug their heels on updating libadplug 
for MONTHS now, I've given up waiting and just included both versions for 
the time being.

* Abbreviate "multi-line" song titles to only display the first line in 
the window titlebars and the "skins" versions of the playlist to stop 
"garbling up" the playlist lines and the window title-bars.

* Add config option to restore Fauxdacious's pretty (pre-v3.9b2) icons in 
the Preferences Window (and may effect other icons in future) as Audacious 
has removed many of their icons in favor of "themed" system-based icons, 
which, at least on my system look flat, colorless, ugly, and inconsistant 
with icons elsewhere in Fauxdacious.  The new option is:
[audacious].use_classic_icons (boolean, default FALSE).  If set to TRUE, 
Fauxdacious uses it's classic icons, otherwise, the ugly new ones.  This 
currently only affects the [Settings] - Preference window, but will  
possibly affect others in the future.

* Merge in all of Audacious's massive redux of it's icons, QT-stuff, and 
numerous other changes since January that I delayed implementing since it 
required massive time and labor to merge while providing little if any new 
functionality (and made the icons ugly too). :(  We are now "caught up" with 
them as of the end of April except for a couple of things, namely their new 
"object-oriented" playlist system (would require tremendous labor to change 
over half the source files in the system with no gain in functionality).

* Set up new "tmp_tag_file" for tags and cover-art for "temporary, one-off" 
video streams (Youtube and Facebook), which "expire" and have to be re-
downloaded if played more than a few hours later.  This permits us to avoid 
having to periodically manually delete the build up of useless cover-art 
images and cruft in our permanent "user_tag_data" file for what are (usually) 
one-off viewing.  This new "tmp_tag_file" (and the cover-art files it 
references) are deleted when playlists are cleared (fauxdacious is started 
with the "-D" option).

* Fixed Audacious-created bug that caused directories to be added as 
invalid items in playlists when option to not unroll subdirectories was set.

* Added support for custom effects settings in the equalizer-preset files.
This option allows the current list of active effects plugins to be 
customized and saved for specific songs, streams, directories and disks!
For example if a specific disk, song, or stream requires the "Dynamic Range 
Compressor plugin" to be used to sound properly, one can now have it 
automatically activated for that entry but off or others so one no longer 
need to manually turn it on for playing that entry!  The new config option 
to enable this feature is:  [audacious].eqpreset_use_effects=TRUE.  A 
new checkbox appears when saving equalizer presets (GTK/Winamp-GTK only) to 
save the current effects plugin status in the equalizer preset file (.preset 
only).  The "Auto" button must also be on in the Equalizer window.

* Added support for directory-specific equalizer-preset files (like XMMS has):
Use new config option:  "eqpreset_default_file=<filename>.preset".  The 
XMMS default for this is "dir_default.preset".  This new option must be 
actually set for directory-specific presets to work (along with the option: 
"equalizer_autoload=TRUE".  The preset file with the specific name must 
exist in the same directory as the song, and does not apply to subdirectories.
Presets will be searched for:  1) the song directory (<songfile>.preset, then 
the ~/.config/audacious[_instancename]/<songfile>.preset (as before), then 
the song directory (<eqpreset_default_file>), then last (as before):
~/.config/audacious[_instancename]/eq.preset.  Does not apply to streams, 
URLs, disks, or other songs that are not files on the local file system.  
(Cue-sheet files are still treated as files though).

* Added support for CD / DVD - specific equalizer-preset files (name the 
preset file name the disk-ID (CDs) or the disk title (DVDs) and saved in 
as ~/.config/audacious[_instancename]/<disk-id/title>.preset.  
(the config option: "equalizer_autoload=TRUE" must also be specified).

(12/25/2017) Version 3.9-beta1

* Added support for using user-created custom tag files for CDs, and 
directories.  This permits the user to create a tag file for his own 
"mash" CDs (ones that obviously aren't going to have track metadata or 
cover art available for lookup online using CDDB, etc.  A new option under 
cdaudio plugin options is "Allow Custom Tag-files" and, if checked, One can 
play the CD and, while playing, use a text editor open 
~/.config/audacious[_instance]/user_tag_data to grab all the paragraphs that 
begin with "[cdda://?...]", save that to a custom text-based tag file called 
~/.config/audacious[_instance]/<disk-id>.tag (disk-id is the calculated 
freedb disk-id for the disk).  The next time the CD is played, the tag 
metadata for the tracks will be fetched from this file.  A custom cover-art 
image can be stored under 
~/.config/audacious[_instance]/<disk-id>.{ping|jpg|jpeg} and used as the 
cover art image for the CD.  

To create a custom tag-file for a music directory (ie. for *.wav files, etc. 
that don't support tags, one can create a tag file, similar to 
~/.config/audacious[_instance]/user_tag_data in a given music directory 
named:  /path/to/your/music/directory/user_tag_data.tag.  Within this file, 
the music file-name keys are specified as just the file name (without the 
"file:///path/.../" part since the tag file only refers to the files 
in that directory.  This can prevent excess clutter in your main 
user_tag_data file!  I created this so when I burn a "mash" CD, I put the 
*.wav track files into a subdirectory and on my computer to save wear and 
tear on the CD drive, I listen to the tracks from the .wav files on my 
hard drive, and wanted to have the track metadata and cover art associated 
with them then!

* New cover-art helper script ("FauxdaciousCoverArtHelper.pl") which can 
be used by Fauxdacious when playing a CD or DVD to attempt to fetch 
cover-art (and for CDs: any missing track metadata) from the web.  
Add the line "cover_helper=/usr/local/bin/FauxdaciousCoverArtHelper.pl" 
in the [audacious] section to your ~/.config/audacious[_instance]/config file.

* Catch up w/Audacious 3.91 GIT by merging all commits through a78fd24 and 
plugin commits through .  Rejected plugin commit:  957d460 (we handle the 
recording gui slighly differently.  Plugin commit a39bfd7 (Adplug) is on hold 
pending further testing and review, and a patch from us is awaiting review 
by the Audacious team.

* Audacious commit a117aba: "sndfile: Don't try to seek beyond end of file. 
(closes Audacious bug #756).

* Merged Fauxdacious commits:  45f08c5-541bf73 
and plugin commits: 641d553-7fe3c80

* Fix rare sigfault when switching back to an aac stream (commit: cba8621)

(06/01/2017) Version 3.83-final

* FIXED filewriter plugin to "fail over" to "unknown" for the filename if 
the playing filename is too long or invalid (needed for youtube streams, etc.).
Also fixed a potential null-pointer reference.

* Added "close after song chg." checkbox for STDOUT output to "close" STDOUT 
when either song stops playing or record is toggled off in order to avoid 
errors in the created output stream.  Otherwise, output to STDOUT accumulates 
as a single long stream until recording stops.  This allows for combining 
multiple songs into a single output file, but can produces (somewhat harmless) 
errors at end of playback in such files.  The default is TRUE (checked) 
(properly close and prevent errors and only record the last song (overwrite).

* Add fixups for ugly but common stream title formats.

* Mandate SDL2 in Fauxdacious main, remove choice to use SDL1 in plugins.

* Merged all Fauxdacious commits thru: 3b24d61; 
and plugin commits thru: a666f70.

* Merged Audacious commits: 7886b7b; and plugin commits:  #9816dc6, 4f327c6, 
10abf7d, 94d95fc, b13a35d.

(06/03/2017) Version 3.83-beta3 (Windows)

* Added DVD-Player Plugin to Windows version, fixed "smudgy menu" problem.

* Updated FauxdaciousURLHelper program (Windows EXE) to correspond to 
latest script version.

(05/25/2017) Version 3.83-beta3

* FIXED bug that occasionally hangs Fauxdacious on startup when loading up 
with a wild-card list of files (usually .wav files), 
ie:  fauxdacious ~/Music/*.wav (Fauxdacious commit #8e3ba79).  
This was due to a mutex deadlock in our song-specific equalizer-preset 
feature code.

* I gave up and made SDL v2 a REQUIREMENT now for Fauxdacious itself (The 
new DVD plugin already requires SDL2).  This is due to the fact that the 
nasty old issue of gtk-window vs SDL segfault kerfuffle resurfaced again 
(see plugin commit #5c09006 for a brief history of this issue), so now we 
will properly initialize SDL in main() since SDL seems to want to pretend 
like it has the "main()" function and must be initialized very early (now 
in main()) in order to play nicely with gtk windows created later 
(Fauxdacious commit #cec5946).  TODO:  Add this to the configure script!

* Added cover-art via the user_tag_file option for both DVDs and Audio CDs.  
User must manually obtain cover art images and store the image files, rename 
them to the same name matching the respective CD or DVD title (shown in the 
playlist) and place them either in the [dvd|CDDA].cover_art_path (config 
file option) or the default: ~/.config/audacious[_instancename]/ directory 
(if not specified) - (plugin commits #5b0f6d7 and #cce218a).  The manual 
requirement is currently due to my inability to find free urls for reliably 
locating cover art programatically by searching with the information at 
Fauxdacious's disposal (the CD/DVD "Title" string and disk IDs).  If I or 
someone else can find and provide URLS for such libraries and scrape logic 
(ok if separate ones for Audio-CDs and/or DVDs), I'll be happy to test and 
include in a future release!

* Merged (mostly) our stdin streaming feature with that of Audacious.  
Our implementation of this feature predates Audacious's and required 
specifying the file extension (as "stdin://-.mp3" for mp3) but theirs does 
not ("-").  Since they now support stdin piping, including seekability via 
buffering during probing, I've now REMOVED my (now ancient) "hacks" to the 
sndfile, vorbis, and gio plugins previously needed to support stdin streaming 
without seeking, and remerged their latest versions of these plugins 
(less maintenance for me - yay)!  I'm leaving it in ffaudio for now though 
as it handles so many different formats.   (commit #8524685, and plugin 
commits # 7b0be4f, 9d4cfa3, 240e090 and 2ba6b75)

With Fauxdacious, one can still include the extension (the old Fauxdacious way) 
and save the overhead of probing all the plugins, however, the extension is 
still REQUIRED for non-"Input" plugins such as cue-sheets ("-.cue") and 
playlist files ("-.pls", etc.), as these do not "probe" to determine what's 
being piped in!  Believe me, I spent a day trying to get the Fauxdacious core 
to "probe" playlists and cue-sheets piped in via stdin, but the underlying 
Audacious architecture simply doesn't permiti it as written.

Also removed the added Fauxdacious requirement of specifying "stdin://-" 
(instead of just "-"), though the old way is still acceptable.  NOTE:  This 
did result in one minor regression:  when piping a simple line-separated list 
of items to play (ie. "ls *.mp3 | fauxdacious -"), one must now specify 
either "-.txt", "-.ls" or "-.m3u" (doesn't matter which) instead of just "-" 
as I've removed the old code in main() that specially handled this and now 
use the standard m3u playlist plugin for this.  

* Instance numbers (single digits) can now be combined with single-letter 
command-line options, ie. "fauxdacious -Dc2" and instance# 0 is now a synanymn 
for th20170429_Fauxdacious3.83-betae default instance (name: audacious) 
(commit #712b923).

* Merge in all Fauxdacious commits through 712b923 and plugin commits 
through b4882eb.

* Merge in Audacious commits:  20ecbff, 9303781, baabb80, 79dcc0f, e859ae3, 
11b4856 (plugin commit a7ba191 has long been part of Fauxdacious).

(04/29/17) Version 3.83-beta2

* Added DVD-playing plugin (Linux version)!  It uses libdvdnav and libdvdread 
to play dvds, including menus.  Issues remain for getting this to work in 
Windows.  This is a first stab at this and it seems to work pretty well so far 
for most DVDs I've thrown at it, but there are several rough edges that remain 
that I have not been able yet to satisfactoraly address:

WARNING:  Playing DVDs that contain CSS encryption DRM requires a special 
decrypting software library that is ILLEGAL in many jurisdictions.  This 
plugin software does NOT contain such decrypting software, but can make use 
of it in jurisdictions where such use is not prohibited.  It is the sole 
responsibility and liability of the user to ensure that such decrypting 
software is legal to use in their jurisdiction before installing and using 
such software with this plugin or any other software and / or hardware capable 
of playing DVD discs.

1)  A small number of menus display with artifacts despite my best efforts 
to flush buffers and force all frames to display.

2)  The audio stream on rare situations does not always play in the desired 
language.

3)  Seeking via the timing slider seems to work well, but the displayed time 
is not meaningful due to the way DVD chapters continue playing after the 
selected chapter completes.  
This needs a lot more thought on how to best handle.

4)  When "playing" a "menu" that has no audio stream, the Fauxdacious 
[Stop play] button will not stop play of the menu, requiring the user to 
click the [x] button in the upper right corner of the video window to 
stop play.  This is a limitation of Audacious (because Audacious is an 
AUDIO player)!  Fixing will require either adding a silent "dummy" audio 
stream to such menus or rewriting the underlying Audacious code (which I 
don't plan to do).

By default, Fauxdacious will add all tracks to the playlist 
(including menus), even though via the menus, most DVDs can be controlled by 
playing only the first track (track 0).  Having the others displayed in the 
playlist enables playing of the individual VOBs found on the DVD, useful for 
playing DVDs that require you to view a bunch of previews before taking you 
to the main menu or movie feature!  To eliminate this "clutter" from the 
playlist, the new config option [dvd].title_track_only to TRUE.

Other new config-file options:

[dvd].first_track_only (boolean, default FALSE).  If set, only Track 1 (the 
2nd track, almost always the main "movie" track) will be displayed in 
the playlist.  If both this and [dvd].title_track_only are set to TRUE, then 
both Track 0 (main menu) and Track 1 (main movie) will be added to 
the playlist.  If neither set, then all tracks will be added to the 
Fauxdacious playlist.

[dvd].nomenus (boolean, default FALSE)  If TRUE, menus will not play, but 
will still be processed - the first or default button will be pressed.  
This is also the course of action if [dvd].play_video is FALSE since, in that 
case, no video screen is shown (audio only plays).  NOTE:  May not work 
ideally with all DVDs, (ymmv).

[dvd].play_video (boolean, default TRUE)  If FALSE, only audio is played.

[dvd].highlight_buttons (boolean, default TRUE) - Draw a grey rectangle 
around each menubutton showing the region in which to click the mouse to 
activate.  (We do not currently do the button subpicture palettes and 
highlighting (hard), so this will have to do for now).

[dvd].menudrain (boolean, default FALSE)  If TRUE, "drains" any remaining 
unwritten audio/video frames before activating the menubutton if it is 
activating another menu.  Also causes display of the menu to be totally 
skipped if [dvd].nomenus is also set.  If set, some menus will not be 
displayed properly, ie. appear "smudgy" or have buttons missing, or may not 
work properly.  If not set (default), you will likely experience some delay 
and some remaining music play between pressing a button and the next menu 
being activated.

[dvd].nomoviedrain (boolean, default FALSE)  If TRUE, prevents "draining" 
any remaining unwritten audio/video frames before activating the menubutton 
if it is activating a movie.  May be necessary for some DVDs to work 
correctly (ie. go to the right feature and play the right audio language, 
not abort with an "Assert 0", etc.  Leave FALSE unless you run into a 
specific DVD that doesn't work properly, they try setting to TRUE and 
reloading the DVD.  If TRUE, you may get some garbled sounds for less than 
a second after activating a menu button before the movie starts.

[dvd].use_cdtext (boolean, default TRUE)  If TRUE, include the title text 
from the DVD as the titles as part of each track, otherwise, "dvd" is used.

[dvd].disk_speed (integer, default 2)  Set the default speed the hardware is 
capable for (similar to [cdaudio].disc_speed.

[dvd].device (string, default "/dev/dvd")  The device name of the dvd drive.

[dvd].fifo (string, default "fifo.mpg")  Name / path of the fifo for the dvd 
reader and writer threads to share.  If only the name is given, it is created 
in the $HOME/.config/audacious/ directory.  You should not need to change this.

[dvd].video_windowtitle (string, default "")  Appended, along with a hyphen 
to the DVD title on the video window titlebar 
(like [ffaudio].video_windowtitle).  The author uses "Fauxdacious DVD".

[dvd].video_xmove, video_xsize, video_ysize, and video_qsize:  (integer) 
similar to the same options in [ffaudio].  Recommended settings:  1, 0, -1, 
and 5 respectively.

NOTE:  The new DVD plugin must be installed separately.  After running 
"make install" to install fauxdacious-plugins, first, make sure that libdvdnav4 
and libdvdread4 are installed, then, simply switch over to the 
fauxdacious-plugins-3.8/src/dvd/ directory and run "make install" again from 
there to install the DVD plugin!  In Fauxdacious itself, under 
Settings.Plugins.Input.DVD Plugin.Settings, make sure that the 
"Play video stream in popup window" box is checked.

* Includes all Fauxdacious commits through 8242198; and plugin commits 
through 2ecd6fd.

* Merged Audacious commits:  a127b46, 2b17e03, 221c248, 6386996, and b55246c.

(03/18/17) Version 3.83-beta1

* FIXED occasional "black screens" when re-starting videos on Windows version 
(never affected Linux/Unix versions)!

* FIXED video screen not always shutting down when Fauxdacious is stopped 
mid-play in a video on Windows version (never affected Linux/Unix versions)!

* Eliminated "hackey" code to always "rescan" ffaudio plugin for "early" 
initialization of SDL2.  This will (hopefully) now permit release of our 
video-capable ffaudio for users of mainline Audacious.

* Added ability to play Youtube and Vimeo videos directly (with seek!) via new 
optional user-supplied helper program/script (similar to and which REPLACES 
the recently-added "tunein_helper" script: getTuneinStream.pl).  With this new 
option ([audacious].url_helper), one can use this script to alter ANY url!  
The new (included) script, in contrib (which will handle youtube, and vimeo 
urls via a regular expression) is FauxdaciousUrlHelper.pl.  Copy it from the 
contrib directory to your executable path, and 
add "url_helper=FauxdaciousUrlHelper.pl" in the "audacious" section of your 
config file and remove the "tunein_helper" line.  
NOTE:  If running M$-Windows, a binary version (FauxdaciousUrlHelper.exe) is 
already in your path with fauxdacious and faudtool)!  You will, however, need 
to add the "url_helper" line above to your config file 
(/Users/<your_userid>/AppData/Local/audacious/config).  For Windows, you must 
also add another section ([neon] and the line:  "ignore_ssl_certs=TRUE" in 
order to play youtube and vimeo videos!

* Upgraded libneon and added SSL capability (to get the https: stream urls 
returned for youtube and vimeo to play).

* Merged in audacious plugin pulls:  fb2d50a, 4c38261, and 221c248.

(03/08/17) Version 3.82-final

* Added the ability to capture the thumbnail images ("cover art") associated 
with youtube video streams.  This also involved changing the 
youtubedl_metadatahelper.pl script.  It now uses youtube-dl to fetch and 
download the thumbnail file when the other tag metadata is fetched.  
By default, it stores them in the /tmp directory, but you can change this in 
the aforementioned perl script.

* GTK equalizer:  Added the [Auto] checkbox, (and relabeled the 
[Reset to Zero] button to [Flat] to make room for it), and added a two-state 
indicator icon to the [Preset] button to indicate whether a song-specific 
preset file is currently in use (so the GTK equalizer now works the same way 
the Winamp Skins equalizer).

* Fixed playlist column headers in the QT interface to work like the GTK 
version, labeling all unlabeled column headers using the same abbreviations we 
used in GTK.  Also on the QT side, there's an optional "Now Playing" column 
(header was blank, but is now labeled "On") which was useless (always blank), 
but now shows an asterisk next to the currently playing song (The GTK side does 
not offer this column, but the currently playing song is displayed 
in bold type).

* Tweaked instance name / dbus handling by adding instance names to the 
window titles (as Audacious does with their instance numbers) and also making 
numbers valid as instance names allowing one to specify the commandline option 
"-#" (ie. -1, -2, etc. in lieu of "--new=1, etc.) for compatability 
with Audacious.  The config directories work the same as Fauxdacious instance 
names with underscores, ie. ~/.config/audacious_1 
(~/.config/audacious_instancename) instead of ~/.config/audacious-1, 
etc. though.  TODO:  Quitting the QT interface exits with a bunch of 
"dbus errors" (warnings) (even before these changes) that I haven't been able 
to explain, though everything still shuts down normally.

* More leaks, more tweaks to ffaudio-core.cc (video playing) and others.  
So far this seems to have pretty much eliminated memory-usage growth creep when 
using SDL1 and further reduced it for SDL2.  Audio-only in both appears 
to be leak-free.  I have not yet been able to completely isolate the source of 
the slight growth in SDL2 (over repeated play of a video) though.  Also added 
new config option:  [ffaudio].video_render_scale.  Default is 1, but valid 
values are 0, 1, or 2.  Sets the SDL_HINT_VIDEO_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY 
hint value.  I think I also have the "black video screen on replay" issue on 
the Windows version fixed.  TODO:  The only remaining issue is that the video 
window still doesn't always close when exiting Fauxdacious with the video 
window playing (on Windows version only - this was never an issue except 
on Windows).

* Merged in Audacious pull request #25: "Add SOCKS proxy support." as written.

* Merged ALL Audacious pulls since 2119d19 through b216d4e; and 0ee73f2, 
d1463c1, 8700688, 217a39f, 4da2cb8, 236ee1d, d6e115e, f47bede; and plugin 
pulls since ab45ec5 through 585518c (everything through 2/13), including their 
resolution of the issue with plugin pull# eaf7949; and 5e9fc66, f4c9b02, 
5b50d20, and 400825a.

(02/16/17) Version 3.82-beta2

* Tweaked and generally tidied up ffaudio-core.cc a bit to make sure AVPackets 
are efficiently initialized and freed properly and slightly optimized play by 
eliminating some redundant video function checks and inlining some calls while 
hopefully eliminating rare and occasionally random seg-fault when stopping 
audio stream play.  There still appears to be a slight bit of memory 
leakage? / growth creep in video play, but my guess it's somewhere deep in 
the bowels of SDL.  

* Changed The default "video_qsize" value from 8 to 6 and Added new 
config option: [ffaudio].allow_highdpi (default FALSE) to enable 
SDL2 SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI flag.

* Merged in all latest QT stuff (finally) and tested and seems to work!  
NOTE:  I did not build it into this release to save file sizes, so you must 
recompile yourself if you want QT configuring with "--enable-qt"!  
NOTE2:  Audacious's QT interface is rather behind, for example Equalizer 
presets and Plugin parameters are NOT currently configurable from the GUI.

* Merged in Audacious pulls# 40237df, 6d9acec, bb439b0, d17911e, 425aa54, 
2119d19; and plugin pulls# ab45ec5.  Did NOT merge plugin pull# eaf7949 due to 
compile error under g++.

* Includes all unreleased Version 3.82-beta1 changes (below):

(Not released) Version 3.82-beta1

* Added new config file option:  [audacious].eqpreset_nameonly (boolean) 
which causes the first question mark (if any) and anything following it in a 
URL to be removed for purpose of exporting song-specific equalization presets.  
This is needed for some live-streaming station URLs that change "keys" 
dynamically and regularly.  Default is FALSE (old behavior - keep the full url 
base name), add and set to TRUE for the new behavior.  For example, this will 
affect youtube-dl urls as well, as previously the preset file would be 
exported as "watch?xxxxxx.preset" where "xxxxxx" was the actual video id.  
With the new option, exporting song-specific equalizer presets will be the 
same preset file "watch.preset".

* Fixed the exporting of song-specific equalization presets for 
cuesheet (.cue) files.  This worked before Audacious apparantly fixed the 
file-name used when opening a song for playback from it's cuesheet filename 
to the actual referenced file-name, breaking our logic.  As a result, the 
equalization presets exported for a cuesheet file will apply to all tracks 
in the cuesheet.  They are still exported (reguardless of track) as 
"<filename>.cue.preset".  I made the decision to do it this way assuming that 
all tracks in a cuesheet are (very likely) recorded with the same 
equalizer settings.

* Merged in Audacious plugin pulls# 2c267a2

(01/30/17) Version 3.81-final:

* Added ability to directly play tunein.com radio stations using the station's 
tunein.com website url (as opposed to having to manually dig out the actual 
live-streaming urls).  This requires the new helper script in the contrib/ 
directory (getTuneinStream.pl) installed in your path, and installing the 
new Perl modules "LWP::Simple" and "Tunein::Streams" from CPAN (www.cpan.org).  

(01/13/17) Version 3.81-beta2:

* Added headers to all columns in GTK playlist.  Previously, some column 
headers were not shown since they were longer than the default column width 
(as determined by a boolean array ui_playlist_widget.cc:pw_col_label).  
I added a separate array of "short" names (columns.cc:pw_col_headers) so that 
all columns are now properly labeled and understood without making them 
unnecessarily wide.

* Merged in Audacious pulls# 361a6fc, c3b0659, b96fbd4, c1fe83b, 11e4915, 
8bea900, 25dd624, 65af13f; and plugin pulls# 25dd624, 0bcc904, 0abceec, 
eb3e8a8, 45c1f38, and a21e4a2

(12/27/16) Version 3.81-beta1:

* Fixed Audacious-rejected bug# 681 to make pause just do pause, as it should!

* Fixed audtool --help to work even if unable to connect to dbus.

* Merged in Audacious pulls# 5297008, a67d6be, b321ee5, and c3287dd; and 
plugins pulls# bf6661e, 403020b and 8174f13, addressing Audacious bugs: 560 
and 685.

* Added comments as another optional column field to the playlist table 
(GTK interface) and made it sortable.  I had started to add this and (on the 
SAME day, the Audacious team added it, so I dropped my work and merged theirs!  
The files I changed were almost identical to their changes, but they had 
finished the ones I hadn't gotten to).  I wanted to make each column sort 
when clicking on the header (like my Tk::HMListbox), but this was going to be 
a huge boondoggle.

* Started looking into adding the ability to sniff out the streams in 
tunein.com online radio stations (and then play them), but this also appears 
to be a ton of work for a small benefit, maybe someday when I get another 
wild hair up my nose!

(11/21/16) Version 3.8-final:  

* Fixed bug in "live_flv" streams that incorrectly reported a stream length 
of "419:57:08" when the length could not be determined, and removed the 
special "NonSeekable" tag we had added previously to work around this and hide 
the position slider and all the supporing code.

* Merged in Audacious pull# 1415ff8 and closing Audacious bug# 680.

* Fixed two huge memory leaks in ffaudio by using smart-pointers to open 
input file, frames, and properly flushing and destroying queues.

* Added queueing for audio packets when playing video.  This makes for 
smoother video-play while allowing for a reduction in the queue-size which 
improves audio-video syncing.  The default "video_qsize" value is now 8 
instead of 16.

* Added separate config option [youtubedl].video_qsize (default: use 
[ffaudio].video_qsize) for Youtube-DL video streams, which seem to need a 
bigger queue.

* Removed the [Services].[Eject CD] from Windows version, since it doesn't 
work anyway because it requires a command that is not included with Windows.

* Added a few lines of code to copy selected playlist entry URLs / files to 
the PRIMARY selection when copying so that they can be retrieved / pasted 
into other applications.

TO DO:  Windows version does not always shut down the video window when 
shutting down without stopping playback first.  Windows version sometimes 
produces black playback window when stopping and restarting play on same item 
fixable by advancing playlist.

(11/8/16):  Version 3.8-beta3:  

* Added Youtube-DL transport plugin to live-stream videos from Youtube, 
Vimeo, and other sites that require using a helper application such as 
youtube-dl in order to play outside of a web-browser.  The plugin recognizes 
any URL with the "ytdl://" prefix and converts that to the proper "https://".  
Simply grab the URL off Youtube and paste it in as a URL in Fauxdacious, and 
change "https" to "ytdl" to add to your playlist.  The video is downloaded and 
piped directly to Fauxdacious without storage to a hard drive, therefore, 
there's no ability to seek.  To do that, simply use youtube-dl to download the 
video and then add the downloaded file to Fauxdacious.  NOTE:  This type of 
piping will require a good internet connection or may require downloading 
lower-quality video formats, otherwise, a buffer-underrun may occur ending 
video playback.  The user may specify / configure the youtube-dl (or other 
helper application) using the new configure option:  [youtubedl].command - 
the default string is:  
"youtube-dl --no-continue --no-playlist --no-cache-dir --no-progress 
--no-call-home --youtube-skip-dash-manifest --prefer-ffmpeg -q -f mp4 
--no-part".  
Do NOT add the "-o -" to feed to stdout, as Fauxdacious does this for you.  
Four additional related user config variables have also been added:  

[youtubedl].video_windowtitle (default "Youtube-DL") for specifying what to 
add to the window titlebar (set to "FILENAME" to get the url); -OR- use the 
included metadata helper script (youtubedl_metadatahelper.pl) to fetch the 
title and author, and then set (in the config file):

[audacious].youtubedl_tag_data=TRUE (default FALSE)

[youtubedl].metadata_helper=/usr/local/bin/youtubedl_metadatahelper.pl 
(default empty)

[youtubedl].save_video (default FALSE).  If true, a copy of the video is saved 
out to either the file path specified by [youtubedl].save_video_file or 
"/tmp/lastyoutubevideo".

NOTE:  If you are compiling from scratch, you'll need to switch to the 
src/youtubedl directory and do a separate make and make install there as it's 
not currently int the configure script.  There's also slim to no chance that 
this plugin will work in M$-Windows.

* Fixed major glitch discovered during all this that caused the video to 
freeze (audio kept playing) if one had a video playing and a url to a 
"live-flv"-based radio stream in the playlist and hovered their mouse over it 
(causing it's metadata to be fetched).

* Added special metadata tag (that can be added to the custom tags file 
(user_tag_data) and that the youtubedl_metadatahelper.pl helper script also 
adds to youtubedl_tag_data called "NonSeekable", which if set to 1 prevents 
display of the file-positioning slider.  This is helpful for certain streams, 
including youtube-dl videos that include a "length" (time) value but which 
are non-seekable.  (If the slider is visable in such a stream and the user 
attempts to adjust it (into the future) playback seizes up and Faudacious must 
be killed to abort).

* Fixed small glitch in the Lavadacious skin so that playlist window now 
expands properly.

(10/29/16):  Version 3.8-beta2:  

* Added config-based file for user-added tag metadata and new 
config-file option:  [Audacious].user_tag_data.  Specify TRUE to activate 
this feature, FALSE or omit to keep old behavior.  This permits user to save 
"song info" for streams (urls) and other files who's decoder does not permit 
saving tag metadata into the media file itself.  I added this to be able to 
assign readable titles to radio streams that otherwise just show the (useless) 
url in the title making it difficult to see which station I'm playing.

* Added the song info popup "balloon" that currently pops up over the 
playlist when the user has the existing option "show_filepopup_for_tuple" 
option set to TRUE to also pop up now for the currently-playing song when 
user hovers the mouse over the middle (equalizer / time part) of the main 
window (Winamp Skins interface) whenever the main window is "shaded" 
(rolled up into a thin line).  This now makes it possible to see what is 
playing without having to pop up the playlist (since nothing regarding the 
current song is otherwise displayed when the main window is shaded)!

* Massively improved video window-resizing, tweaked video-scaling smoothness 
to improve video quality back to SDL1 level (fixed small degradation in SDL2).  
Added resizing feature to allow user to shrink video window below a 
user-specified size (default 149x149, user-configurable by the 2 new config 
file variables:  [ffaudio].video_doreset_width and 
[ffaudio].video_doreset_height) and have it snap back to it's 
originally-requested size.  

* Fixed video-play to work in headless mode.

* Additional minor tweaks to improve video efficiency.  

(10/20/16):  Version 3.8-beta1:  Snapshotted latest Audacious v3.8 GIT as of 
2016/10/13 and manually refactored and reapplied all Fauxdacious features and 
changes.

* Rewrote the ffmpeg plugin (ffaudio-core.cc) to use SDL2 for video and latest 
ffmpeg / avcodec API while remaining backward-compatable with prev. ffmpeg 
release (now compiles without warnings (these were all 
"depreciated" warnings).  This also eliminates muting issues on playback when 
using the SDL "Output" audio system and the nasty manual-editing of separate 
Makefile and extra.mk files for Linux and Windows.  Also refactored and 
tweaked to slightly better optimize video performance and include all 
Audacious v3.8 improvements possible (excluding their new "SmartPtr" and 
"Scoped" structs) which I was not able to get fully working compatably with 
Fauxdacious video features.

* Added a [Close] button to the Equalizer window in the GTK interface.  

* Merged in post-3.8 final commits:  97257b6 and (plugins) 43a6bf1.

(05/31/16):  Version 3.74-beta2:  Fixed glitch that prevented creating 
song-specific Equalizer Auto-presets for Cue-file based songs.  Added the 
song / video title to the Fauxdacious Video window titlebar.  Merged Audacious 
commits:  3be5957, 450984e, e12ae5d, 2349933, d768ae1, 3cd305e, 60c4632, 
475490c, 5384dc5, b855336, b34cbdb, c729ff5, ad0a172, 6b5bfae, 96a19b5, 
5a8d6e5, and Plugin commits:  4ededd4 and ebf17e6.  Eliminated (most) compiler 
warnings in ffaudio-core.cc from "depreciated" AVCodec stuff.  Obtained a 
working version of libcue and compiled that in.  Updated the Win32 build notes 
in the contrib directory to reflect additional Fauxdacious requirements and 
fixes for module compilation issues.  

TODO:  Only known unresolved issue (Windows) is audio is sometimes lost when 
jumping from some videos to audio playlist items when using SDL Output plugin, 
non-issue if using the new Waveout plugin.  Also probably need to add a 
"file-association" in the Windows setup wizard to associate .xspm 
(playlist files) with Fauxdacious.  Someday, if I really get ambitious, I 
might write / modify a plugin merge in "youtube-dl" functionality in order to 
play Youtube video URLs directly, patches / help / advice welcome!  When 
Audacious v3.8 comes out and settles down, I should remove the "beta" moniker 
as Fauxdacious seems pretty stable now.  I need to create a DEB package too, 
but looking at the documentation howto for that just gave me a headache.  At 
least John Lindgren's Audacious build instructions for Windows were concise 
by comparisen!

(05/27/16):  Version 3.74-beta1:  Built Windows installable binary and 
bundled with Inno Setup Wizard.

(05/18/16):  Version 3.73-beta2:  Changed multi-instance feature to use unique 
config directories now (like the new Audacious multi-instance feature does) 
instead of just unique config files.  The default config directory remains 
"~/.config/audacious/" whereas new instances created with --new=instancename 
are now "~/.config/audacious_instancename/".  The config file is now once 
again always "config" within the directory "~/.config/audacious_instancename/" 
instead of "instancename".  The default instance name remains "audacious" so 
that Fauxdacious shouldn't create a "~/.config/audacious_audacious/" 
directory, even if that instance name is specified.  Also updated the manpages.
Commits merged:  60d1ce5, 2908e84 (taylored for our instance-names), 
9dde289, 34d5a2d, 7abddc7, c75b543, 66767b6, 8e5122c, 1cf1a81, d74d231, 
e31774c, 577298c, 32dbd44, 02fb683, 3aaa228, f208db4, 6087afd, 1c8d8e0, 
8f3fcc4, and 1c9c04c.

(05/13/16):  Version 3.73-beta1 Released.  The Audacious Team has been very 
busy of late fixing bugs and adding features for a future 3.8 release and I'm 
having a hard time keeping up with all of their changes (and rejections)!  
I've decided to call this release the first beta of version 3.73, skipping 
3.72 due to many 3.8 GIT fixes and features included from their latest 
development commits.  Some of their recent commits have involved moving and 
combining code from many source files and QT features which I have not had 
the time or patience to do, test, and include here, so I have focused my 
efforts on cherry-picking commits that actually fix things and add features 
for users in this release, and included a few minor touches of my own!  
Audacious bugs/features fixed/added and closed by this release:  628, 629, 
630, 637, and 638.  Commits merged:  d4e7a38, 149ceb2, 91182a1, 44de6de, 
762a447, 1d5ae03, 54abb4e, 10dad29, ed2f46f, 59ab0aa, ecbc461, 0eefebb, 
507f3b0, 4558f91 and perhaps a few others I forgot to write down.  Pretty 
much through May 6th or so, unless listed here.  I did reject 
(specifically 63b0f41 (video needs SDL), e19cf1d, 2908e84, 45d6887, 
and 77ae4c6) ones involving their new multiple-instance feature for now as 
we already long have that implemented in a different way, but may incorporate 
their separate configuration directory aspect of that later.  Theirs appears 
to use instance numbers and instance-specific configuration directories 
whereas ours already uses instance names and only the "config" file itself 
is instance-specific.  I also have neglected to update many QT-specific 
commits as I don't currently compile that in nor use it and probably won't 
unless people start specifically asking me for it.

New Fauxdacious-only features implemented include new "set-volume-relative" 
audtool option (rejected feature#637), The "About" popup window is now 
toggleable by the lower-right corner button in WinAmp skins (previously you 
had to press the <Esc> key to close that popup).  Also Fauxdacious will now 
no longer leave the "Record/Dub" feature enabled when closed and later 
reopened, a major annoyance that has bitten me a couple of times 
(fixes rejected bug#629).  I've also updated the Lavadacious skin to clean up 
some titlebar and other apparance issues.  Also added new violet version of 
the Default skin (DefaultViolet) and added a gtk-2 theme portion to the 
Lavadacious theme.  Added a "Changes" file.

(4/29/16):  Version 3.71-beta3 Released.  Removed debug output used to 
fix/verify the popup fix in the last version. Merged in cherry-picked 
Audacious v3.72 commits: 2113b3d, 6ed0f32, 133802e, fcbb689, and 4d1c41e thus 
closing bug#627.  Iâve also got a shiny new machine that also has 
Windows-7 Professional 64 bit on it with a hard drive big enough to install 
all three dozen or so libraries on it, so hopefully soon, I can begin 
building a Windows binary version to be combined with the free 
Inno Setup Wizard!  

(2/26/16):  Version 3.71-beta2 Released.  Seems to fix the popup 
"missing file" error message mentioned at the bottom of the post. Also 
includes most recent Audacious GIT update commits through 2/26!

(12/13/15):  Version 3.7-beta2 Released, fixed annoying error msg. popup that 
occasionally comes up saying it can’t find a 
(should've been deleted) playlist.
