This is the official M$-Windows executable installer (Fauxdacious_install.exe), 
created by the Inno Setup Wizard installer application 
(https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).  The file "Fauxdacious.iss" is the Inno 
script used to "compile" this binary.

This is the easiest way to install the latest Fauxdacious version on M$-Windows 
systems, such as Windows-7 and higher.  For more information about Fauxdacious, 
see:  https://wildstar84.wordpress.com/fauxdacious/, or for the source-code, 
see:  https://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious and 
https://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious-plugins 

To install Fauxdacious and all it's official plugins, simply:

1)  Download the executable installer binary "Fauxdacious_install.exe" to 
somewhere on your Windows machine, your desktop perhaps.

2)  Click on it to run the installer.  You will be asked to accept the (open 
source) license agreement, where to install (the default should work fine), 
and whether to create a desktop shortcut icon.  If successful, you will be 
shown the "README" and asked if you want to launch Fauxdacious.

3)  Start & enjoy Fauxdacious Media Player for Windows!

4)  Optional:  go to Settings.Advanced, and at the bottom, enter the following 
"helper" program names (if not already there) in the 3 "helper program" fields 
at the bottom:  FauxdaciousUrlHelper.exe FauxdaciousCoverArtHelper.exe, and 
FauxdaciousLyricsHelper.exe respectively.  This enables several powerful 
extra Fauxdacious features (see https://wildstar84.github.io/fauxdacious/FAQ.htm) 
for more details.  This is all optional and unnecessary to run Fauxdacious.  
NOTE:  The source code for the three helper programs is in the same directory 
where you installed the program under \bin and are named ".pl" (Perl) instead 
of ".exe".

For the brave, and open-source purists out there who wish to compile from 
source instead, see:  https://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious/blob/master/contrib/win32/fauxdacious_buildnotes.htm 
for how this was built.  You will also need to download and unzip the file: 
"faud.zip" in C:\, and the file "patches.zip" somewhere and apply all the 
patches (one-time) as instructed in the link above to create the proper build 
environment.  NOTE:  The source-code from GitHub (above links) supercedes the 
Fauxdacious source links in the buildnotes link above.
